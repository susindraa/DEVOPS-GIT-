Great question! Let's break down the difference between `--soft`, `--mixed`, and `--hard` resets in Git. These all move the **HEAD** (your current branch pointer) to a different commit — but they differ in **what happens to your staging area and working directory**.

### 💡 Think of it like this:
- 🧠 **Soft**: Keep everything, just go back in history (undo commits, but keep the work staged)
- 👐 **Mixed**: Undo commits and unstage everything (efault behavior if no flag is provided)
- 💣 **Hard**: Blow everything away — commits, staging, and working changes gone
---
## 🧪 Examples
### ✅ `--soft`
```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```
- Undoes the last commit
- Leaves changes in **staged** area
---
### ✅ `--mixed`
```bash
git reset --mixed HEAD~1
```
- Undoes the last commit
- Leaves changes in **working directory** but **unstaged**
---
### ✅ `--hard`
```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```
- Undoes the last commit
- **Deletes changes** in both staged and working area
---
## ⚠️ Caution
- Use `--hard` only if you're **sure** you want to discard local changes.
- Always run `git status` first to check what's going to be lost.
