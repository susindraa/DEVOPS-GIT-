## ðŸ§¾ Bonus Tip: Keep This Structure Handy for Interviews

> **"Docker is a lightweight containerization technology that allows applications to be packaged with their dependencies. It supports DevOps by enabling consistent environments across development, testing, and production."**

You can keep this line and build upon it during interviews.
