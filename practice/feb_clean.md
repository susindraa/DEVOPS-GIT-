Should Convicted Persons Contest Elections?
The Supreme Court (SC) is hearing petitions seeking a lifetime ban on convicted persons from contesting elections.
Related Legal Provisions
- Under Section 8(3) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, a person convicted of a criminal offense
with a sentence of at least two years is disqualified from elections during imprisonment and for six years after release.
- Section 8(1) mandates disqualification for various crimes (e.g., promoting enmity between different groups,
rape, untouchability, unlawful association, corruption etc.) regardless of sentence duration, plus six years post- release.
Need for Lifetime Ban for Convicted Politicians
1. Upholding Integrity in Public
Office- Lawmakers should maintain the highest ethical standards. Allowing convicted individuals, especially for heinous crimes (rape, murder, corruption), to contest elections undermines public trust in democracy.
✓ Singapore's zero-tolerance policy on corruption (Convicted individuals are permanently barred from contesting elections) has ensured a clean political landscape.
1. Preventing Criminalization of
Politics- Reports by ADR show that 46% of MPs in 2024 have criminal cases, with 31% facing serious charges.
1. Equal Standards for Public Servants and Politicians- Government employees with criminal convictions are
permanently disqualified from holding office.
1. Ensuring Free and Fair Elections- Candidates with criminal backgrounds have a higher chance of winning
(15.4%) compared to those with clean records (4.4%). Banning convicted politicians would level the playing field and promote merit-based leadership.
1. Enhancing Public Trust in Democracy- Voters expect clean governance. A lifetime ban would restore faith in
the electoral process and ensure that only those with a clean record serve in legislative roles.
Counterarguments Against a Lifetime Ban on Convicted Politicians
- Judicial Delays May Lead to Wrongful Convictions: India has a slow judicial process, and wrongful convictions
are not uncommon. Many politicians face politically motivated cases that may take decades to resolve.
- Possibility of Political Vendetta & False Cases: In 2023, one MP was convicted in a defamation case and
disqualified from Parliament, raising concerns about selective targeting.

Way Forward
1. Amending the Representation of the People Act, 1951 – for introducing a legal provision explicitly barring
individuals convicted of heinous crimes (rape, murder, corruption, terrorism, etc.) from contesting elections for life.
1. Defining Serious Offenses Clearly – and establishing a clear framework distinguishing minor offences from
those involving moral turpitude, ensuring the ban is applied fairly and preventing misuse for political vendetta.
1. Judicial Oversight on Disqualification – Setting up a “fast-track” judicial process to review and confirm
disqualifications, ensuring fairness and preventing politically motivated disqualifications.
✓ Fair & Transparent Review Process: A three-tier system (Trial Court → High Court Review → Supreme Court Finality) can prevent arbitrary disqualifications.
1. Strengthening Political Accountability – by mandating political parties to refuse tickets to candidates with
serious criminal records. The EC should enforce strict penalties on parties that violate this norm.
✓ Only parties adhering to clean governance norms should be eligible for state funding for elections.
1. Public Awareness and Electoral Reforms – Educating voters about criminal records of candidates, promoting
clean governance initiatives and encouraging them to elect representatives with ethical backgrounds.
✓ The ‘Know Your Candidate’ campaign by Election Commission of India increased voter awareness about candidates' backgrounds.
✓ Role of Media & Civil Society: EC should collaborate with civil society organizations to run large-scale voter awareness campaigns. Example: The ADR (Association for Democratic Reforms) regularly publishes reports on criminal records of MPs/MLAs.
1. Judicial Review of EC’s Powers – The EC’s authority to reduce disqualification periods should be reviewed for
constitutional validity, ensuring transparency and consistency in election laws.
✓ In Canada, an independent Ethics Commissioner oversees election disqualifications to prevent bias.
1. Aligning Politicians with Government Servants’ Standards – by implementing similar eligibility criteria
ensuring equal accountability ✓ Parliamentarians as Public Servants: Article 311 protections (which govern civil servants) should be extended to elected representatives to ensure equal accountability.
Devolution Index Report Recently, the Devolution Index Report titled “Status of Devolution to Panchayats in States – An Indicative Evidence Based Ranking 2024” was released by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj and Indian Institute of Public Administration (IIPA), with Karnataka securing the top position.

President’s Rule (Article 356) The President’s rule was imposed in Manipur recently due to ongoing ethnic violence between the Meitei and Kuki-Zo communities since May 2023. The conflict began over the Meitei demand for ST status, opposed by the Kukis. A political crisis deepened after Manipur Chief Minister resigned on February 9.
About Article 356 of the Constitution – President’s Rule It provides the framework for imposing President’s Rule in a state if the constitutional machinery fails.
When is it Imposed?
•If the President, based on the Governor’s report or other information, believes that Article 356 the state government cannot function as per the Constitution, they can impose President’s Rulethrough a Proclamation.

## Page 8

The Governor carries on with the administration of the state on behalf of the President with the help of the state's Chief Secretary and other advisors/administrators appointed by him.
Does It Affect Fundamental Rights?
No, the President’s rule does not affect citizens’ fundamental rights, unlike a national emergency (Article 352).
Does It Result in Dissolution of State Assembly?
Under President’s Rule, the State executive is dismissed, and the legislature is either suspended or dissolved. In Manipur’s case, the Assembly, with a tenure until 2027, has not been dissolved but placed under “suspended animation,” meaning it is temporarily paused and can be revived once forming a popular government becomes feasible after the revocation of President’s Rule.
✓ In 111 cases of President’s Rule till 2015, the State’s Legislative Assembly had been dissolved simultaneously with the proclamation 53 times, according to the Lok Sabha Secretariat’s report. In the remaining instances, the legislature has been placed in suspended animation.
Key Takeaways
- Article 356 is meant for handling governance breakdowns in a state.
- It cannot be misused indefinitely, as it requires Parliamentary approval and time limits.
History of President’s Rule in India
- Frequency of Imposition- Since 1950, the
President’s Rule has been imposed 135 times across 29 states and UTs. Manipur (11 times) and Uttar Pradesh (10 times) have seen it most frequently.
✓ Punjab was the first state where President’s rule was imposed in 1951.
✓ West Bengal and Karnataka have been under the President’s rule for the minimum duration i.e. 7 days only.
✓ No Instances of President’s Rule has been witnessed in the Chhattisgarh, Telangana.
- Longest Duration Under Central Rule- Jammu
& Kashmir (J&K) (9 times) holds the record, spending over 15 years under President’s Rule, mainly due to militancy and instability followed by Punjab (over 10 years) and Puducherry (over seven years).

S. R. Bommai v. Union of India (1994): A Landmark Judgment on President’s Rule The S. R. Bommai case was a turning point in Centre-state relations, placing significant restrictions on the arbitrary use of Article 356 of the Constitution. The verdict played a crucial role in upholding federalism, democratic accountability, and constitutionalism in India.
Background Before 1994, the Central government frequently misused Article 356 to dismiss state governments, often for political reasons.
SC’s Verdict in S.R. Bommai Case
1. Judicial Review of President’s Rule: The President’s power under Article 356 is not absolute. The SC can review
the imposition of President’s Rule to check for illegality, malafide intent, abuse of power, or extraneous considerations.
✓ While the President’s subjective decision cannot be challenged, the court can examine whether there was relevant material to justify the proclamation.
✓ Post-Bommai, the SC reviewed the dismissal of Arunachal Pradesh case (2016) and Uttarakhand (2016) governments, reinforcing that misuse of Article 356 is justiciable.
1. Guidelines for Protecting State Governments: The court created guidelines to protect the independence of
state governments which involves- a. Legislative Assembly Suspension, Not Dissolution: After President’s Rule is imposed, the State Legislature be suspended, not dissolved, unless Parliament approves the proclamation within two months.
b. Revival of Dismissed Government: If Parliament does not approve the proclamation, the dismissed government must be reinstated.
c. Limited Scope for Centre’s Power: The judgment established that Article 356 can be invoked only in extreme cases. The Centre cannot use Article 356 arbitrarily; it must act in line with constitutional principles.
1. Strengthening Federalism: The judgment reaffirmed that states are not subordinate to the Centre, thereby
enhancing cooperative federalism.
Impact of the Judgment
1. Reduced Misuse of Article 356: Between 1950 and 1994, President's Rule was imposed around 100 times, an
average of 2.5 times a year. After Bommai, the frequency of the President’s Rule significantly declined (once per year), reinforcing federalism and state autonomy.
1. Judicial Check on Executive Power: The ruling curbed the Centre’s ability to impose the President’s Rule for
political reasons, ensuring greater democratic stability in states.

Immigration and Foreigners Bill, 2025 The Immigration and Foreigners Bill, 2025, is set to be introduced by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) in the ongoing Budget session.
About the Immigration and Foreigners Bill, 2025 The Immigration and Foreigners Bill, 2025 seeks to consolidate and streamline immigration and foreigner-related regulations by replacing following legislations formulated during World Wars I & II: Foreigner's Act of The Immigration (Carriers’ Liability) Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920 and 1946 enacted to Act, 2000, which holds carriers the Registration of Foreigners Act, 1939 confer upon the responsible for transporting passengers require passports of persons entering India; Central government into India in violation of the Passport and to provide for the registration of certain powers in (Entry into India) Act, 1920, and its foreigners in India.
respect of foreigners. associated rules.
Objective: To eliminate overlapping provisions and streamline laws on passports, travel documents, visas, and foreigner registration for efficient entry and exit regulation in India.
Key Provisions
1. Immigration Control and Administration: The Bill defines the roles and powers of Immigration Officers,
establishes the legal framework for the Bureau of Immigration (BoI) and mandates the requirement of passports, visas, and other necessary travel documents for entry into India.
1. Registration of Foreigners: The Bill specifies the obligations of foreigners regarding their registration with the
Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO).
1. Obligations of Institutions and Accommodations: Universities, educational institutions, hospitals, nursing
homes, and medical institutions are required to provide information about foreign nationals admitted to their institutions. Hotels and guest houses must continue to share foreign guests’ passport details with the police.
There was no defined rule earlier for such institutions; foreigners were asked to register with FRRO.
VAJIRAM AND RAVI The Recitals (February 2025) Page 9

## Page 11

1. Entry Restrictions and Removal of Foreigners: Foreigners deemed a threat to national security, sovereignty,
foreign relations, or public health may be denied entry or stay in India, with the Immigration Officer’s decision being final. The Bill codifies existing executive powers and expands the Centre’s authority to issue removal orders, delegate powers, and grant exemptions.
1. Penal Provisions: Unauthorized entry into India without a valid passport or travel document is punishable by
imprisonment of up to five years or a fine of ₹5 lakh or both. Using or supplying forged travel documents, passports, or visas is punishable by imprisonment of two to seven years and a fine ranging from ₹1 lakh to ₹10 lakh. Overstaying beyond the visa period is punishable with imprisonment of up to three years and a fine of ₹3 lakh.
1. Regulation of Foreigners' Movement: The Bill grants authorities the power to restrict foreigners' movements,
regulate frequented places. It also maintains the burden of proof on individuals to establish their citizenship.
1. Role of Carriers: The Bill places a legal obligation on transport carriers (airlines, shipping companies, etc.) to
remove foreigners denied entry into India. Carriers must also provide necessary details about their passengers to the authorities.
1. State Authority in Immigration Enforcement: State governments and their police forces are empowered to
detect and deport undocumented migrants within their jurisdiction.
1. Detention and Holding Centres: The Bill does not explicitly use the term "detention centres", but states that
foreigners with restricted movement must “reside at a designated place under supervision.” These places will be governed by rules regarding maintenance, discipline, and access, as determined by the Central Government.
States are authorized to set up such centres without requiring explicit approval from the Centre.
Digital Tracking and Identification Mechanisms for Foreigners
- The MHA has directed States to form committees to identify foreigners overstaying beyond their visa period
since January 1, 2011. Details of such individuals are uploaded on the e-FRRO portal, accessible to local police and government agencies.
- Additionally, the Foreigners Identification Portal enables State police to track and record biometrics of illegal
migrants for deportation and document verification.
- The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) has been tasked with creating a negative list of Aadhaar
cards obtained fraudulently.
Need for the Bill
- Eliminating Overlapping Laws: The bill replaces four outdated laws and provides a unified legal framework for
managing immigration.
- National Security Concerns: It strengthens provisions to prevent unauthorized entry and movement of
foreigners.
- Regulation of Foreigners: It formalizes procedures for visa issuance, registration, and tracking of foreign
nationals in India.
- Stronger Penalties: The bill enhances penalties to deter illegal immigration and document fraud.
- Simplification for Authorities: It empowers Immigration Officers and provides clarity in enforcing immigration
laws.
Benefits of the Bill Concerns Raised
1. Efficient Immigration Process: Streamlined procedures 1. Potential for Misuse: The discretionary power

Power To Grant Furloughs The Hashimpura massacre convicts have challenged a Delhi prison rule in the Delhi High Court (HC), arguing that furloughs, usually granted by the executive, are instead left to the court handling their appeal.
✓ On May 22, 1987, Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC) personnel allegedly killed around 38 Muslim men in Hashimpura, Meerut, amid communal tensions.
What do the Delhi Prison Rules 2018 Say?
Chapter XIX of the Delhi Prison Rules 2018 governs furlough and parole. Note 2 of Rule 1224 states that if a convict's appeal is pending before the HC or the appeal period has not expired, the executive cannot grant furlough. Instead, the convict must seek court directions.
✓ This rule has been challenged in the HC.
Why is it Being Challenged?
Petitioners argue against restricting furloughs in such cases. However, the Delhi prison administration, in its 2022 affidavit, defended the rule, stating it was intentionally included based on the Parole/Furlough Guidelines, 2010, approved by the then Lt. Governor.
Parole versus Furloughs Reformative Justice Approach: Both parole and furlough align with the idea of prisoner rehabilitation rather than pure retribution.
Aspect Parole Furlough Nature Conditional release is subject to Conditional release is subject to good behavior in good behavior in prison and to not prison and to not committing specific offences.

Effect on Sentence is suspended; duration Sentence continues to run despite release. For Sentence remains intact. example, a 10-year sentence with a 30-day furlough means the convict serves 9 years, 11 months but is still considered to have completed the full term.

necessary.
** State Variations: Given that prison administration is a state subject, there are variations in how parole and furlough are implemented across different states. For example, Maharashtra's prison rules allow furlough as a matter of right to certain categories of prisoners, whereas states like Uttar Pradesh have more stringent norms, especially for prisoners convicted of heinous crimes.
**Supreme Court Precedents: Asfaq vs. State of Rajasthan (2017) distinguished parole as a privilege and furlough as a right (subject to conditions).
** UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (Nelson Mandela Rules, 2015): Recognizes the role of community ties in reducing recidivism.
Delhi HC’s Interpretation of the Rule So Far
1. Single Judge Bench’s View: The term "High Court" in Note 2 of Rule 1224 refers to the appellate court, which
includes both the Delhi HC and the Supreme Court (SC). If a convict’s appeal is pending before the SC, then only the SC can grant furlough.
1. Current Examination by Division Bench: It is considering whether a convict can apply for furlough in the Delhi
HC while their appeal is pending in the SC or if they must approach the SC directly. It is also reviewing the
### constitutional validity of the rule which includes:
a. Violation of Fundamental Rights: The rule is being tested against Article 14 (Right to Equality) and Article 21 (Right to Life & Liberty) to determine if it unfairly discriminates against convicts whose appeals are pending.
✓ If convicts whose appeals are pending before the SC are denied furlough while those whose appeals are pending in the HC can get it, it may create unequal treatment among similarly placed individuals.
b. Reformative Justice: The court will assess whether denying furlough to a well-behaved convict—simply because their appeal is pending in the SC- contradicts the reformative approach to punishment.
c. Parole vs. Furlough: Since furlough does not suspend a sentence (unlike parole), the court will decide if legal principles applied to parole should also apply to furlough.
Who Decides on Suspension of Sentence?
- The issue dates back to the 1959 KM Nanavati (an Indian Navy Commander) case, where the Bombay HC
convicted him for the murder of his wife’s lover. Before his appeal reached the SC, Governor Vijayalakshmi Pandit suspended his sentence under Article 161 (Power of Governor to grant pardons, etc., and to suspend, remit or commute sentences).
- In 1960, a four-judge SC Bench ruled that a Governor cannot suspend a sentence if the case is pending before
the SC, as it would undermine the court’s appellate authority.
Is Furlough Commonly Denied in case of the Pending Appeal?
- Yes, some states do not grant furlough or parole if a convict’s appeal is pending before the HC, requiring them
to seek relief from the court instead.

- In 2023, in a dowry case, it was argued before the SC that parole and furlough differ from sentence suspension
or bail, as they are granted by the State Government per its rules.
- Acknowledging the issue, an SC Bench called for urgent attention from the Union and State Governments. The
matter is still pending.
Ranveer Allahabadia’s Row The Supreme Court (SC) recently granted interim protection from arrest to podcaster Ranveer Allahbadia over FIRs linked to his remarks on YouTube show India’s Got Latent.
Background
- Controversial Remarks & Public Outrage: During an episode of India’s Got Latent, hosted by Samay Raina,
Ranveer Allahbadia made a crude joke that was deemed offensive and obscene. The remark triggered public outrage
- Legal Action & Police Involvement: FIRs were filed in Maharashtra and Assam under obscenity laws. The
Maharashtra Cyber Police and Assam Police booked Allahbadia, Raina, and others involved. The National Commission for Women (NCW) summoned Allahbadia, Raina, and five others over the incident.
- SC’s Interim Relief & Bail Conditions: Allahbadia approached the SC, seeking relief from multiple FIRs and
potential arrest. The SC granted interim protection, but imposed stringent conditions, including:
- Ban on posting content on social media until further orders (effectively a gag order (prior restraint)).
- Surrendering his passport, restricting international travel.

imprisonment and a fine upto 10 lakh rupees) for publishing

₹5,000 fine for first-time offenders. in electronic form.
Similar Controversies Around Obscenity in India
- Urfi Javed Controversy (2023): Complaints were filed against actor Urfi Javed for wearing "indecent" outfits in
public. The case sparked debates on freedom of expression vs. public morality.
- Ranveer Singh’s Photoshoot (2022): The actor was booked under Sections 292, 293, 509 of IPC and Section 67A
of the IT Act for his nude photoshoot for Paper Magazine. Critics debated whether artistic expression should be classified as obscenity.
- Milind Soman Beach Photograph (2020): The Model-actor was booked by Goa Police for uploading a nude
running photograph on a beach. The case raised questions about personal freedom and artistic liberty in public spaces.
Evolution of Indian Judiciary’s View on Obscenity
1. Lack of Clear Definition in Indian Laws: which do not explicitly define obscenity, leading courts to interpret
and evolve standards over time. Until 2014, Indian courts relied on the Hicklin test to determine obscenity.
➢ The Hicklin Test (1868) originated from the Regina vs. Hicklin (1868) case in English law. It defined obscenity based on whether any part of the work could "deprave and corrupt" susceptible minds. India applied this test in Ranjit D. Udeshi vs. State of Maharashtra (1964), leading to the ban of DH Lawrence’s book Lady Chatterley’s Lover which was considered scandalous for the times and faced obscenity trials in several countries, including the UK and India.
➢ MF Husain Case (2008): The Delhi HC ruled that nudity in art is not obscene unless it crosses societal acceptability. This verdict was upheld by SC striking a balance between artistic expression and societal sensibilities.
1. Shift in Obscenity Standards in the UK and US
- In United Kingdom, the Obscene Publications Act, 1959, changed the standard to assess a work "as a whole",
not just isolated portions.
- In Roth v. United States, 1957 the US SC ruled that obscenity should be judged by “contemporary community
standards” and whether the work’s dominant theme appeals to prurient interest.
1. Adoption of the Community Standards Test in India (2014): Influenced by international legal shifts, India,
influenced by the Roth case, moved away from the Hicklin test in Aveek Sarkar v. State of West Bengal (2014).
The case involved a semi-nude photo of Boris Becker and his fiancée. The SC ruled that:
- Obscenity must be judged using contemporary societal norms rather than the views of a small, sensitive
group.
- A work must be evaluated as a whole in its intended context.
What about Freedom of Expression?
- Restrictions on Free Speech: The right to freedom of speech and expression is guaranteed under Article
19(1)(a) of the Indian Constitution. However, this right is not absolute and is subject to reasonable restrictions VAJIRAM AND RAVI The Recitals (February 2025) Page 14

---
## Page 16

under Article 19(2) in the interest of decency and morality, among other grounds. This means that speech or content deemed obscene can be penalized if it violates contemporary moral standards.
- Balancing Free Speech with Community Standards: Courts have ruled that freedom of expression must be
weighed against evolving societal norms. This ensures that artistic, literary, or journalistic expression is not stifled unnecessarily while preventing genuinely obscene material from circulating. Thus, context, intent, and community standards play a crucial role in determining whether content is obscene or protected speech.
Need for Digital Content Regulation to Avoid Obscenity
- Regulatory Challenges and Legal Hurdles: New media, including Over-the-Top (OTT) platforms, YouTube and
social media, lack a specific regulatory framework. The IT Rules, 2021 introduced a three-tier grievance redressal system and age-based content classification, but parts of these rules remain stayed by courts, delaying their full implementation. India still lacks a comprehensive law for digital media regulation.
✓ The IT Rules, 2021 introduced self-classification for digital content, categorizing it into age-appropriate ratings (U, U/A 7+, 13+, 16+, A).
✓ YouTube follows the IT Rules' digital media code but is treated as a social media intermediary for user- generated content. It isn't liable for such content unless it fails to comply with government directives like blocking and due diligence.
- Preventing Obscenity and Indecency: Unregulated digital content may include explicit scenes, vulgar language,
objectification of women, encourage immoral behavior or inappropriate themes that could violate cultural sensibilities. Regulatory mechanisms help in curbing such content.
- Protecting Cultural and Moral Values
- Safeguarding Children and Vulnerable Audiences: Implementing age restrictions and content filters can help
protect younger audiences.
- Preventing Misuse of Freedom of Expression: The right to freedom of speech comes with reasonable
restrictions to prevent the spread of offensive or obscene content under the guise of creative liberty.
Recent Steps Taken by the Indian Government
- IT Rules (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) 2021: Introduced guidelines for OTT platforms
and social media intermediaries to ensure content moderation.
✓ Mandated social media platforms to appoint a Grievance Redressal Officer, a Compliance Officer, and a Nodal Officer for law enforcement coordination.
- Self-Regulation by OTT Platforms: Many digital streaming platforms have adopted content classification
systems and parental controls.
✓ The Digital Publishers Content Grievance Council (DPCGC), under the aegis of the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI), serves as an industry-led self-regulatory body for content complaints.
- Censorship of Unlawful Content: The government can act against digital content that violates public decency
and morality. Section 69A of the IT Act, 2000 empowers the government to block online content in the interest of sovereignty and security).
✓ India banned TikTok, PUBG, and 58 other Chinese apps in 2020 citing national security threats.
✓ Crackdown on deepfake videos: Following the rise of AI-generated deepfake videos, the government has pushed platforms for stricter AI content regulations.
Way Forward
- Comprehensive Legislation – Enacting a dedicated law for digital content regulation, covering OTT and social
media.
- Independent Regulatory Body – Establishing a neutral authority to oversee digital content.
- Platform Accountability – Enforcing stricter compliance for content moderation on digital platforms.

Overseas Mobility (Facilitation and Welfare) Bill, 2024 The Indian government is actively considering the Overseas Mobility (Facilitation and Welfare) Bill, 2024 to modernize migration policies and ensure safe, orderly, and regular migration for Indians seeking overseas employment.
Background: The bill comes at a time when the US is deporting illegal Indian immigrants under the Trump administration's policies. India has also seen an increasing number of migrant workers heading abroad, necessitating a legal framework that reflects current global migration dynamics.
✓ 20,000 undocumented Indians are facing deportation under Trump 2.0’s mass deportation policy.
✓ Total undocumented Indian population in the US: 7,25,000, the largest group outside Latin America.
✓ The fourth batch of deported Indians has recently returned to India.
About the Overseas Mobility (Facilitation and Welfare) Bill, 2024 India boasts one of the world's largest diasporas, with ~15.85 million Indians residing overseas. These individuals contribute significantly to the nation's economy, with remittances reaching around $100 billion in 2023, positioning India as the top recipient globally.
The bill seeks to replace the outdated Emigration Act of 1983 to ensure structured, transparent, and legal migration channels, safeguarding Indian workers from exploitation and fraudulent recruitment practices.
What is the Emigration Act of 1983?
It replaced the earlier Emigration Act of 1922 and aimed to regulate overseas employment and to protect Indian workers heading to Emigration Check Required (ECR) countries (nations with weak labour laws that require special clearance for Indian migrants). The law also established Protector General of Emigrants (PGE) and Protector of Emigrants (PoE) offices to monitor migration.
✓ The Act classifies Indian passport holders into ECR (Emigration Check Required) and ECNR (Emigration Check Not Required) categories.
✓ ECR countries include UAE, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, and others.
What are the issues with this act?
- Lack of structured employment provisions: The Act does not sufficiently address overseas job opportunities.
- High risks of exploitation: Many Indian workers face fraudulent recruitment, wage theft, and contract
discrepancies.
✓ Cases of domestic workers in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait facing wage non-payment, physical abuse, and contract violations.
- Irregular migration: Many Indians still migrate through illegal and unregulated routes, making them
vulnerable to exploitation.
✓ Kerala and Tamil Nadu workers using tourist visas to enter Gulf countries and then overstaying illegally.
- Outdated: As it does not account for modern migration trends, digital recruitment, or emerging labour
markets.
Therefore, the Overseas Mobility Bill, 2024, seeks to address these gaps and ensure better protection for Indian migrants.
VAJIRAM AND RAVI The Recitals (February 2025) Page 16

## Page 18

Key Objectives of the Bill
- Updating Emigration Policies: By replacing the Emigration Act of 1983 and introducing a modern framework
for migration, the bill will facilitate circular mobility, allowing workers to move between India and foreign countries for employment.
✓ Example: India-UK Young Professionals Scheme allows short-term employment opportunities for skilled professionals.
✓ India-UAE Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) facilitates smoother labor mobility.
✓ The e-Migrate portal already assists in recruitment regulation; the bill will enhance its scope.
- Enhancing Worker Protection & Welfare: The bill aims to protect Indian migrant workers from exploitation,
mistreatment, and fraudulent recruitment agents. Indian embassies and consulates will play a more active role in ensuring workers’ welfare abroad.
- Strengthening Migration Infrastructure: It plans to expand PoE offices in migration-heavy states like Punjab
and Uttar Pradesh. These offices will oversee recruitment processes and combat illegal recruitment. Assistance will be provided for employment disputes, mistreatment and contract violations.
✓ Punjab’s Doaba region sees large-scale migration to Canada & UK—new offices will improve governance.
- Ensuring Safe Migration Practices: The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) will raise awareness about safe
migration, valid job opportunities, and legal recruitment agencies. It will also assist in rescue and repatriation of workers in distress.
✓ The introduction of blockchain-based authentication for work permits and contracts can reduce fraud.
UAE’s Wage Protection System (WPS) tracks salary payments to prevent wage theft.
- Grievance Redressal and Repatriation Support: A stronger complaint resolution mechanism will be put in
place. Indian workers facing mistreatment abroad will receive legal aid and repatriation assistance. Families of affected emigrants will receive timely updates and support.
✓ Pravasi Bharatiya Sahayata Kendra (PBSK) in Dubai offers emergency assistance.
Implications of Proposed Bill
### 1. Benefits for Indian Migrant Workers:
Easier and Safer Migration- A clear legal process will reduce fraud and illegal migration.
Protection from Exploitation- Strict rules will prevent cheating by recruitment agencies and employers.
Better Support Abroad- Indian embassies will help workers with legal issues, job disputes, and safe returns if needed.
### 2. Economic Benefits for India:
More Money from Remittances- Legal migration will increase money sent back home, boosting India's economy.
Stronger Global Job Market- Indian workers will have better chances in Gulf countries, US, and Europe.
Better Relations with Other Countries- A well-regulated system will improve India’s reputation and encourage work agreements.

Trump’s Reciprocal Tariffs & its Impact On India Recently, US President Donald Trump announced plans to impose "reciprocal tariffs" on all countries, with implementation from April 2nd. By targeting both allies and adversaries, Trump signals a shift away from established trade norms.
Trump’s Shift to Reciprocal Tariffs
- Trump’s "reciprocal tariffs"
policy seeks to eliminate preferential treatment for any country.
- Under this system, the US will
impose the same level of tariffs on imports as other nations impose on US exports.
- The exact calculation method
for reciprocal tariffs is still being finalized, with the US trade department expected to determine the final rates for each country by April.
- However, it is clear that the US plans to consider various subsidies and financial assistance provided by other
countries to their exporters.
o This means that if a country like India offers subsidies to its industries, the US may factor those into its tariff calculations to create a "level playing field." VAJIRAM AND RAVI The Recitals (February 2025) Page 19

---
## Page 21

- If this approach is strictly implemented, developing nations like India, which heavily subsidize exports, will
face higher tariffs on their goods in the US market.
o For instance, between 2022 and 2024, India provided $1 billion (₹8,700 crore) in subsidies under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme to boost exports.
o Since the PLI scheme is essentially a subsidy, it could lead to higher US tariffs on Indian goods.
Reciprocal Tariffs - Impact on India
- Given India's historically high tariffs on US goods, it is expected to be among the nations most affected by
Trump's decision.
Bilateral trade (April–Nov India's exports to US: India's imports: Trade surplus in India's 2024): $82.52 billion $52.89 billion $29.63 billion favour: $23.26 billion
- Increased US goods Imports
 To balance trade, India may import more US goods, including defence equipment, oil, and consumer products. This could lead to a reduction in India's trade deficit with the US.
- Rupee Depreciation
 Higher imports from the US would increase demand for dollars, leading to a weaker Indian rupee against the US dollar.
- Impact on Domestic Consumption & GDP Growth
 The recent Rs 1 lakh crore tax break in India aimed at boosting consumption may lead wealthy Indians to spend more on US goods, rather than on Indian products.
 This could limit the expected boost to India's GDP, as more money flows into the US economy instead.
- Long-Term Benefits & Risks
 Cheaper US goods could benefit Indian consumers.
 Stronger trade ties with the US could help India’s economic growth and global positioning.
 However, this might undermine Atmanirbhar Bharat, as more US imports reduce demand for Indian- made products.
- Potential Sectors at Risk for India
 Although India is not an immediate target, US trade restrictions may focus
### on high-value Indian exports, including:
✓ Pharmaceuticals (21.9% of India’s consumer goods exports to the
## US).
✓ Gems & Jewellery (9.6%).
✓ Fisheries (shrimps & prawns) (6.6%).
 Other sectors that may come under scrutiny include automobile, chemical products, textiles, and wood pulp.

Conclusion Trump’s aggressive trade policies have set off a high-stakes economic confrontation, with potential global repercussions. As tariffs take effect, inflation, economic disruption, and strained international relations are likely to dominate Trump’s second term.

## SOCIAL ISSUES
PwDs Are Worried About Digital Personal Data Protection Rules The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) is finalizing public consultations on the Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act, 2023 and its draft rules.
- However, disability rights activists have raised serious concerns over a specific provision in Section 9(1), which
clubs adult Persons with Disabilities (PwDs) with children and mandates that their legal guardians provide consent for any digital personal data processing.
- Activists argue that this undermines the autonomy of PwDs and reflects a flawed understanding of
guardianship laws.
Understanding the Controversial Provision – Section 9(1)
- The DPDP Act requires data fiduciaries (organizations processing data) to obtain verifiable consent from a
parent/ legal guardian before processing personal data of a child/ PwD with a lawful guardian.
- The definition of PwDs in this provision lumps all
individuals with disabilities together, assuming that those with guardians are incapable of making legally binding decisions.
- The draft rules under Rule 10(2) require
verification that the guardian was appointed by a court or designated authority under Indian guardianship laws.
- While the rule provides detailed explanations for
child consent, it lacks clarity on how guardianship- based consent would apply to PwDs, leading to confusion.
Risk to Digital Rights of PwDs
- Making guardian consent mandatory for accessing
### online services could lead to:
o Exclusion from digital platforms like banking, govt. schemes, e-commerce, and education portals.
o Increased control of guardians over PwDs’ choices, restricting their ability to make personal decisions.
o Legal ambiguity for guardians, who may face penalties under the DPDP Act if their consent leads to data misuse.
- A survey by PACTA and Saksham Disability found that 27.4% of PwDs had legal guardians, yet most of them
managed their affairs independently, contradicting the assumptions made by the DPDP Act.
### Recommended changes by disability rights groups include:
- Amending Section 9(1) to align with the RPWD Act, 2016, ensuring PwDs have decision-making autonomy.
- Providing clear guidelines on how data fiduciaries should handle guardian-based consent for PwDs.
- Ensuring that digital accessibility barriers are addressed, as many platforms are still not user-friendly for
PwDs.

Controversy Around Three-Language Policy The Union Government has withheld ₹2,152 crore in Samagra Shiksha funds from Tamil Nadu for refusing to join the PM SHRI scheme due to its opposition to implementing the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020.
While the State is willing to participate in PM SHRI, it rejects the NEP’s three-language formula, preferring its longstanding two- language policy.
Centre insists on compliance, citing constitutional alignment, but Tamil Nadu government refuses to yield, calling it “blackmail” and questioning the constitutional basis of such mandates.
Opposition to this policy in Tamil Nadu
- Tamil Nadu has a long history of resisting
the imposition of Hindi.
- 1965 Anti-Hindi Agitation
o In 1965, violent protests erupted in Tamil Nadu against making Hindi the sole official language, resulting in at least 70 deaths.
o The unrest resurfaced in 1968 when the Parliament mandated Hindi teaching under the three-language formula.
- Dravidian Movement’s Stand
o In 1968, the DMK government under C.N. Annadurai passed a resolution rejecting the three-language formula, reinforcing Tamil Nadu’s two-language policy of Tamil and English. Since then, successive governments have opposed any changes to this policy.
- Recent Opposition and Policy Adjustments
o In 2019, strong resistance from Tamil Nadu led to the removal of mandatory Hindi learning from the draft NEP proposed by the Kasturirangan Committee.
o The State continues to uphold its two-language system, resisting any attempts to introduce Hindi in schools.
Perceived Imposition of Hindi
- Political parties and activists in Tamil Nadu see the three-language policy as a covert attempt to impose Hindi.
They argue that practical constraints, such as the lack of resources for additional language teachers, would naturally lead to Hindi being the default third language.
- Government Actions Fueling Suspicion
o The Union Government’s promotion of Hindi, including a ₹50 crore allocation in 2019 for appointing Hindi teachers in non-Hindi-speaking States, has reinforced concerns.
o Critics point out the lack of similar efforts to promote south Indian languages in northern schools or Kendriya Vidyalayas.

women from unpaid domestic duties to paid jobs has economic
### benefits, including:
o Higher household incomes
### o Enhanced productivity:
More women in the workforce can drive economic growth.
o Formalization of labor and social security benefits.
### • Social and Policy Implications:

UGC-CARE List Scrapped The University Grants Commission (UGC) has decided to discontinue the UGC-CARE (Consortium for Academic and Research Ethics) list of quality academic journals.
Instead, it will provide a set of suggestive parameters for selecting journals based on eight criteria.
Reasons for Withdrawing UGC-CARE
- Concerns with the UGC-CARE List
o Over-centralisation in deciding journal quality.
o Delays in adding or removing journals.
o Limited inclusivity, particularly in fields like Tamil studies.
o Lack of transparency, leading to the exclusion of highly respected Indian-language journals.
- Shift to a Decentralised Approach: The UGC argues
### that decentralisation will:
o Help combat predatory journals more effectively.
o Make institutions responsible for evaluating journals.
o Allow flexibility for institutions to develop their own mechanisms aligned with UGC’s suggested parameters.
o Ensure evaluation models can adapt to evolving fields and disciplinary needs.
- Expert Committee Review (2023)
o UGC formed an expert committee to review the CARE system which took the decision to discontinue it in October 2023 Concerns on Scrapping the CARE List
- Potential Rise of Predatory Journals
o Academics fear that eliminating the CARE list removes a key safeguard against predatory journals.
o Without a central oversight mechanism, low-quality and exploitative journals may thrive.
- Lack of Public Consultation
o An academic described the move as “retrograde”, arguing that there should have been public consultation before scrapping CARE.
The New Approach to Journal Evaluation
- Suggestive Parameters for Institutions
o The UGC has introduced non-binding ‘suggestive parameters’ to help institutions assess journals.
o These parameters include evaluating the journal’s editorial process, peer review system, and the expertise of its editorial board.
- Institutional Responsibility & Accountability for developing their own mechanisms to evaluate journals.
- Decentralisation & Academic Freedom
o Faculty and researchers can assess journals based on discipline-specific criteria rather than relying on a centralised list.

Budget Allocation for Urban Development In 2015, the then government prioritized urban development, recognizing cities' 67% contribution to GDP.
However, in its "Viksit Bharat" vision, urban development appears to be overlooked.
Budget Allocation for Urban India
- Total Outlay - ₹96,777 crore, up from last year’s
₹82,576.57 crore. However, adjusting for inflation, the real allocation has declined.
- Underutilisation of Funds - Revised Estimates
indicate only ₹63,669.93 crore will be spent by March, reflecting a 22.9% shortfall.
- Cuts in Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana Urban)-
Allocation for FY 2024-25 was ₹30,170.61 crore, but Revised Estimates slashed it to ₹13,670 crore.
- Policy vs. Implementation Gap - Despite
increased outlay, funds are misaligned with urban infrastructure needs, prioritizing capital- intensive projects over employment and sustainable development.
Way Forward for Urban Development
- Introduction of the Urban Challenge Fund
o A new ₹10,000 crore fund announced for urban redevelopment.
o Target set at ₹1 lakh crore, with 50% expected from private investments.
o Reliance on private funding seems unrealistic, given past low participation
- Shift Towards Capital-Intensive Projects that generates employment and sustainability
o Focus on green jobs and inclusive economic growth.
Need for a Law on Domestic Workers The Supreme Court’s recent directive to the Union government to explore the feasibility of a separate law for domestic workers is a significant step toward recognizing their rights.
- The Court has ordered the Centre to form an inter-ministerial committee to examine the necessity of a legal
framework for domestic workers’ protection, regulation, and welfare.
Key Considerations for a New Law
### ● Clear definition and employment proof:
○ An inclusive definition of domestic work is necessary for effective regulation.
○ Proof of employment is a critical prerequisite for enforcing labour laws.
○ Workers' unions have demanded mandatory employer registration to address this issue.
### ● Employer resistance and workplace recognition:
○ Resistance by employers needs to be taken into account. Many employers do not consider themselves as such, nor do they view their homes as workplaces.
VAJIRAM AND RAVI The Recitals (February 2025) Page 49

## Page 51

○ Any new legislation should ensure minimum entitlements and grievance redressal mechanisms.
- Recognise regional & local aspirations while formulating laws.
Way Forward
- Regional efforts, such as those in Kerala should
be examined. In Kerala, domestic workers are primarily protected under the "Kerala Domestic Workers (Regulation and Welfare) Act, 2021", which ○ Outlines their ✓ Rights to minimum wages, ✓ Dignified working conditions, written contracts, and ✓ Protection against exploitation, including provisions for regulating employment agencies placing domestic workers with employers.
○ Stipulates regarding working hours, rest days, and mandatory social security benefits.
- Concerns of the domestic workers’ unions must
be taken into account while framing any law.
While immediate transformation may be challenging, such a law would serve as a foundation for long-term improvements in their working conditions and social status.

## POLITY AND GOVERNANCE
Bhopal Criminalizes Begging Bhopal has banned begging in all public places, including giving alms. The Bhopal District Collector recently issued orders enforcing strict measures, including FIRs for both beggars and donors. The move revives debates on anti- begging laws, often criticized as ‘anti-poor’ over rehabilitation-focused approaches.
✓ In December 2024, Indore’s collector also banned almsgiving under Section 163 of Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS) as part of the Union government’s Support for Marginalized Individuals for Livelihood and Enterprise (SMILE) scheme, 2022 which aims to rehabilitate beggars through medical care, education, and skill training to make cities “beggar-free” by 2026.
Legal Status of Begging Across Other States
- Bombay
Prevention of
### Beggary Act, 1959:
Begging is criminalized in several states under the Bombay Prevention of Beggary Act, 1959, which allows authorities to detain beggars and place them in institutions. The law has its roots in colonial-era vagrancy laws.
✓ The Bombay Prevention of Begging Act, 1959 serves as the definitional basis of the SMILE scheme identifies “begging” not only as the act of soliciting alms but also activities like performing on the streets; selling items to earn a livelihood; or merely appearing destitute with no visible means of subsistence.
✓ In 2018, the Delhi High Court (HC) decriminalized begging and struck down parts of the Bombay Act as “manifestly arbitrary”, violating Article 21 (right to live with dignity). The court questioned how the state could criminalize begging while failing to provide basic necessities.
✓ In 2021, the Supreme Court (SC) rejected a PIL to remove beggars, refusing an “elitist view” on a socio- economic issue.
- The Persons in Destitution (Protection, Care and Rehabilitation) Model Bill, 2016: proposed repealing the
Beggary Act and replacing it with rehabilitation centers in every district. Some provisions still allowed police involvement and detention, leading to concerns from activists. Discussions on the Bill stalled after 2016, and no further progress has been made.
- ‘Beggar-Free City’ Policies in States: Despite the 2018 Delhi HC ruling, many states, including Maharashtra,
continue to criminalize begging under similar laws. Several states have announced plans to make cities “begging-free”. In 2020, the Union Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment proposed a rehabilitation- focused campaign in ten cities, including Mumbai, but the Beggary Act remains in force.
- Mental Healthcare Act, 2017: Includes provisions for caring for detainees with mental illness who are
homeless or found wandering. It aims to provide medical care rather than criminal punishment for mentally ill individuals found begging.

PRASHAD Scheme A Parliamentary committee, citing slow progress in Spiritual Tourism Circuits under the Pilgrimage Rejuvenation and Spiritual Heritage Augmentation Drive (PRASHAD) scheme, has urged the government to establish a clear Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) and secure prior approvals for timely project completion.
✓ The Ministry of Tourism launched the Spiritual Tourism Circuits under the Swadesh Darshan Scheme to promote spiritual and religious tourism.
✓ The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Transport, Tourism, and Culture noted that five of the 23 Spiritual Circuits remain incomplete, with two in Kerala—the Sabarimala–Erumeli–Pampa–Sannidhanam and Sivagiri Sree Narayana Guru Ashram circuits—lagging behind schedule since their initiation in 2016-17 and 2018-19, respectively.
Implementation Hurdles in PRASHAD Scheme
1. Delayed Project Completion: Slow approvals and bureaucratic red tape hinder project timelines. For example,
Spiritual Tourism Circuits like the Sabarimala–Erumeli–Pampa-Sannidhanam Circuit in Kerala remain incomplete despite work starting in 2016-17.
1. Lack of Coordination & Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Multiple agencies (Tourism Ministry, State
Governments, local authorities) are involved, leading to overlaps and inefficiencies. Poor interdepartmental communication also causes delays in clearances.
1. Funding and
Resource Constraints: Although 100% publicly funded, projects often struggle with inadequate fund allocation and delayed disbursals.
CSR and PPP contributions are not consistent, affecting private sector involvement.

1. Infrastructure and Connectivity Issues: Poor Road, rail, and air connectivity in remote pilgrimage destinations.
Insufficient transport and accommodation facilities for tourists.
1. Environmental and Heritage Conservation Concerns: Unregulated tourism at religious sites leads to pollution,
overcrowding, and damage to heritage structures. Lack of proper waste management systems increases environmental degradation.
1. Community Engagement and Local Opposition: Local communities are sometimes not adequately consulted,
leading to resistance in project implementation. Lack of awareness and skill development programs affect livelihood benefits.
Way Forward
- Streamline approvals and ensure timely fund disbursal.
- Strengthen inter-agency coordination between state and central authorities.
- Improve last-mile connectivity and sustainable infrastructure.
- Implement strict heritage conservation policies to prevent environmental damage.
- Enhance community participation through training and employment opportunities.

Recent Developments and Challenges
- Non-Statutory Status: Operating without statutory authority since 2004 has limited the Commission's
enforcement capabilities, necessitating periodic extensions of its tenure.

- Resource Constraints: The Commission often contends with limited financial and human resources, impacting
its operational efficiency and outreach.
- Persistent Hazardous Practices: Manual scavenging and unsafe sewer cleaning practices continue in various
regions. Between 2020 and 2024, there were 294 reported sewer-related deaths in India.
Extra Mile: Various Initiatives for Sanitation Workers
- National Action for Mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem (NAMASTE): Launched in 2022 as a Central Sector
Scheme. It aims to eliminate hazardous manual cleaning of sewers and septic tanks by promoting mechanization and ensuring the safety of sanitation workers.
- GARIMA Scheme: Launched by the Odisha state government in 2020, the GARIMA scheme focuses on the
safety and dignity of core sanitation workers.
- Sanitation Workers Rehabilitation Scheme (SWRS): Implemented by the National Safai Karamcharis
Finance and Development Corporation (NSKFDC), SWRS provides financial assistance to sanitation workers.
- Social Security and Welfare Schemes: Various social security initiatives have been extended to sanitation

✓ Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana: Life insurance coverage at nominal premiums.
✓ Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana: Accidental death and disability insurance.
✓ Atal Pension Yojana: A pension scheme ensuring financial security post-retirement.
- Swachh Bharat Mission 2.0 guidelines direct MoHUA to emphasize sanitation worker well-being,
prompting ULBs to improve occupational safety.
Bifurcating Railway Zones Recently, the Union Cabinet granted ex post facto approval for the establishment of the new South Coast Railway (SCoR) Zone with its headquarters in Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh.
✓ The SCoR zone will be the 18th zone of the Indian Railways. Its jurisdiction has been carved out from parts of the East Coast Railway and South-Central Railway zones.
✓ The Cabinet also split Waltair Railway Division (earlier under the East Coast Railway), among the largest revenue-generating areas of the Indian Railways, into two parts, renaming one part Visakhapatnam under the new zone and creating a Rayagada division under East Coast Railway.
Significance of Waltair Division It is a key revenue generator due to its freight traffic from Odisha and Chhattisgarh's mining and steel industries.
In 2023-24, it contributed 74.66 million tonnes to East Coast Railway’s record 250 million tonnes of freight loading.
The move to transfer its revenue-rich section to South Coast Railway has sparked criticism from Odisha’s opposition leaders over economic concerns.

Election Commissioner and Other Election Commissioners (Appointment, Conditions of Service and Term of Office) Act, 2023.
About the Chief Election Commissioner and Other Election Commissioners Act, 2023 It introduced significant changes to the selection process, salary structure, and eligibility criteria for appointing Election Commissioners in India.
New Selection Process for CEC & ECs Previous Appointment Process The CEC and Election Commissioners (ECs) are now appointed by the President based on the recommendation of a selection committee Earlier, the Election Commission comprising: (Conditions of Service of Election Commissioners and Transaction

or defect in the Selection Committee's constitution.
Key Changes Under the New Act
- Salary: Aligned with Supreme Court (SC) judges. The bill initially proposed it to be equivalent to a Cabinet
Secretary but after protest by opposition it was decided to retain the status on par with Judges of SC
### • Eligibility Criteria (Newly introduced):
 Candidates must be of high integrity.
 Must have experience in managing elections.
 Must be serving or retired Secretaries (or equivalent) to the Government of India.
What Remains Unchanged?
- Tenure & Reappointment: Unchanged at six years or until 65 years of age, whichever is earlier, with no
reappointment.
- Removal: The CEC can be removed from office in like manner and on like grounds as a SC judge (Article 324(5)
of Indian Constitution), while ECs can only be removed on the CEC’s recommendation.
Why Was the Process Changed?
In the Anoop Baranwal vs. Union of India case, the SC ruled that the Election Commission of India (ECI) must be independent and recommended a collegium-style selection process, including PM, LoP and the Chief Justice of India (CJI). However, Parliament passed the 2023 Act, replacing the CJI with a Union Minister, giving the Executive greater control over appointments.
Controversy & Legal Challenge: Several petitions, including one by Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), challenged the law in the SC, arguing that it weakens the ECI's independence. The SC refused to stay the law but agreed to hear the case. A verdict is pending.
✓ The current appointment came hours after LoP Rahul Gandhi, while submitting a dissent note urged a delay in the appointment until the SC’s ruling in the case.
VAJIRAM AND RAVI The Recitals (February 2025) Page 58

## Page 60

Concerns Raised Regarding the CEC and Other ECs Act, 2023
- Government Dominance in Selection Committee: The 2023 Act removed CJI’s presence, increasing executive
control. The Selection Committee gives the ruling government a majority, reducing the Election Commission’s independence.
✓ In tribunals, from past cases, removing judicial members from selection panels has led to legal challenges regarding fairness.
- Power to Ignore Search Committee’s Recommendations: with the Selection Committee to pick candidates
outside the suggested panel weakens the Search Committee’s role in ensuring qualified and impartial appointments.
✓ This provision opens doors for politically favorable appointments. Example: In the CBI selection, ignoring the empaneled list has led to allegations of favoritism.
- Risk of Government Influence Over Salary: Earlier, the CEC & ECs’ salary was equal to that of SC judges, fixed
by Parliament. The bill links their salary to a Cabinet Secretary, which is controlled by the government, increasing potential Executive influence. This provision was later removed in the Act
- Narrow Eligibility Criteria: Only those who have served as government secretaries (or equivalent) can be
appointed. This excludes legal experts, election specialists, and other qualified individuals who could strengthen electoral oversight. Bureaucrats may be influenced by past government affiliations.
- Lack of Parity in Removal Process among CEC & EC: The CEC can only be removed like a SC judge whereas ECs
can be removed on the CEC’s recommendation. This creates an imbalance despite both having equal decision- making powers.
✓ A pro-government CEC could recommend removing ECs who oppose government actions.
- Functioning of Selection Committee with Vacancies: If the LoP position is vacant (e.g., before elections), the
committee will consist only of government members, affecting neutrality in decision making.
- Administrative Independence Not Addressed: Recommendations for an independent ECI secretariat (like
Parliament or the SC) were ignored, keeping the ECI dependent on the government for resources.
Way Forward
- Enhancing Selection Committee Balance by including neutral members like the CJI.
- Expanding Eligibility Criteria to include legal experts, election specialists, and retired judges.
- Restoring Salary Parity with SC judges to ensure financial independence.
- Reviewing Removal Process to ensure removal procedures are in line with constitutional principles of fairness
and independence.
- Establishing Periodic Oversight to assess Act’s impact on electoral integrity and recommend improvements.

Losing Membership of Parliament (MP) under Article 101(4) Incarcerated Khadoor Sahib MP Amritpal Singh has moved the Punjab & Haryana High Court (HC) seeking permission to attend the ongoing Parliament session, fearing loss of his seat under Article 101(4) due to prolonged absence.
✓ Article 101(4) states that if an MP of either House of Parliament misses all meetings of the house for 60 days without its permission, excluding periods when the House is prorogued or adjourned for over four days then the House may declare his seat vacant.
✓ Amritpal Singh, detained in Dibrugarh under the National Security Act (NSA) since April 2023, won the 2024 Lok Sabha election from prison but has only 2% attendance, as per PRS Legislative Research.
About National Security Act (NSA), 1980 The NSA has roots in the Defence of India Act, 1915, and Preventive Detention Act, 1950 (lapsed in 1969).
The NSA allows for preventive detention to maintain national security and public order.
### Key Provisions:
1. Detention: The Central (National Security and Defense (Entry 1, Union List)) or State Government (Public
Order (Entry 1, State List)) can detain any person posing a threat to national security, public order, India’s relations with foreign powers or essential services.
✓ District Magistrates or Police Commissioners may also issue detention orders for up to three months, extendable with government approval. Detention orders must be reported to the State Government within 12 days and to the Central Government within 7 days if approved.
1. Grounds for Detention: Authorities must inform a detained person of the reasons for detention within 5
days (or 15 days in exceptional cases with written justification) and provide an opportunity to appeal to the government.
1. Validity of Detention Orders: A detention order remains valid even if:
(a) The detained person is outside the issuing authority's jurisdiction.
(b) The detention location is outside the jurisdiction of the issuing authority.
1. Advisory Board: Central and State Governments constitute Advisory Boards when needed. Each board has
three High Court judges or qualified persons, with one appointed as Chairman. Governments must present detention cases within three weeks of detention to the Boards which review materials, seek further details if needed, and submit reports within seven weeks. If detention is justified, the government may continue detention as needed otherwise the person must be released immediately.
✓ Proceedings and reports remain confidential, and detainees cannot have legal representation before the Advisory Board.
1. Temporary Release: The government may temporarily release a detained person with or without conditions
and can revoke the release anytime for this purpose, the person may need to sign a bond and must surrender as directed. Failure to comply can result in up to two years' imprisonment, a fine, or both, and forfeiture of the bond.
1. Protection Clause: No legal action can be taken against officials if they acted in good faith under NSA
provisions.
Is There Any Previous Instance where an MP has Lost his/her Seat under Article 101(4)?
No, as per former Lok Sabha Secretary General P D T Achary, Article 101(4) has never been invoked in the history of the parliament.
✓ Other constitutional provisions (like defection under the Tenth Schedule or criminal disqualification under RPA, 1951) have led to MPs losing their seats.
✓ Suspensions vs. Disqualifications – Many MPs have been suspended for disruptions but not disqualified for absence.
VAJIRAM AND RAVI The Recitals (February 2025) Page 62

## Page 64

Is There Any Other Option Available with the MPs to Avoid Losing Their Seat?
Yes, the key term in Article 101(4) is “without permission of the House”. Therefore, MPs with long absences seek approval from the Committee on Absence of Members.
What is Committee on Absence of Members?
- It reviews and makes recommendations on each leave application, which are then ratified by the House
concerned. These applications are rarely rejected.
- MPs have previously been granted leave for illness or imprisonment, for instance Ghosi MP Atul Rai in 2023
got permission to remain absent on 23 consecutive sittings of Parliament due to imprisonment.
What if an MP is Absent for more than 60 Days?
Even after 60 days of absence, the House must vote to declare a seat vacant. In the case of Amritpal Singh, this voting aspect can prevent him from losing his seat.
National Dam Safety Authority (NDSA) The Supreme Court (SC) recently directed a supervisory committee, led by the National Dam Safety Authority (NDSA) chief, to examine Tamil Nadu's concerns over Kerala’s maintenance of the 125-year-old Mullaperiyar dam.
About NDSA Headquartered in New Delhi, the NDSA was established under the Dam Safety Act, 2021 as part of a 4-tiered institutional mechanism. It came into force in 2022 and aims to maintain dam safety standards, prevent dam- related disasters, and resolve inter-state disputes regarding dam management.
4-tiered institutional mechanism under Dam Safety Act, 2021 It consists of: 1) National Committee on Dam Safety (NCDS); 2) NDSA; 3) State Committee on Dam Safety (SCDS); and 4) State Dam Safety Organization (SDSO).
- National Committee on Dam Safety (NCDS)-Apex body at the national level: It advises on policies and
regulations for dam safety; reviews dam safety measures and standards. Chairman of Central Water Commission is the ex officio Chairman of NCDS.
- NDSA acts as a regulatory authority to implement policies, guidelines, and standards devised by the NCDS.
- State Committee on Dam Safety (SCDS): Apex advisory body at the state level: It reviews and advises on safety
measures for dams in the state and ensures implementation of safety guidelines and standards.
- State Dam Safety Organization (SDSO): It is the technical arm of the state government. It conducts inspections
and risk assessment of dams and enforces dam safety standards and regulations.
✓ As per the National Register of Large Dams compiled by the Central Water Commission, India has 5745 nos.
of dams (5334 are completed and 411 are under construction stage).
✓ In terms of Dams, India is the third largest country in the world after the USA and China.
✓ Over 80% of large dams are more than 25 years old, and over 200 dams exceed 100 years, leading to structural weaknesses and heightened safety concerns.
Functions & Responsibilities
- Regulates, oversees, and inspects dams to ensure safety.
✓ The Hirakud Dam (Odisha) has experienced sedimentation issues. NDSA can guide de-siltation efforts to improve its long-term viability.
- Resolves disputes between State Dam Safety Organizations (SDSOs) or between an SDSO and a dam owner.
Krishna and Godavari River disputes have often seen conflicts over dam operations. NDSA provides a framework to ensure scientific, data-driven solutions.
- Conducts awareness programs to educate citizens on dam safety.

Structure & Leadership: Headed by a Chairman, it is supported by five members leading: Policy & Research Technical Regulation Disaster & Resilience Administration & Finance Remission Without Application The Supreme Court (SC) recently directed states with remission policies to consider the premature release of prisoners even if they don’t apply for remission beforehand. The ruling, delivered in the Suo motu case In Re: Policy Strategy for Grant of Bail, aims to address prison overcrowding.
✓ Remission refers to the reduction of the duration of a prison sentence for a convicted person. This does not remove the conviction but shortens the punishment period based on legal provisions. It is granted based on good conduct, age, health, or humanitarian considerations.
✓ Unlike parole or furlough, remission leads to early release without any obligation to return to jail.
Legal Provisions for Remission
- State Government’s Power of Remission: Section 473 of the BNSS (Bhartiya Nyaya Suraksha Sanhita, 2023)
and Section 432 of the CrPC (Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973) empower state governments to remit sentences "at any time." ➢ Govt. can attach conditions to the remission, such as requiring the convict to report regularly to the police.
➢ If the convict violates these conditions, the remission can be canceled, and the person can be re-arrested without a warrant.
- Restriction on Remission for Certain Convicts: Section 475 of the BNSS (and Section 433A of the CrPC) places
restrictions on remission for convicts sentenced to life imprisonment for offenses punishable by death. Such convicts must serve at least 14 years in prison before they become eligible for remission.
** The BNSS and the CrPC mention that the remission process starts “Whenever an application is made to the appropriate Government” from the convict.
** Countries like Germany & Canada have successful early release programs with job placement assistance.
Presidential & Governor's Clemency Powers
- The President (Article 72) and the Governor (Article 161) of India also have the power to grant remission,
but these are separate from the state government's remission powers.
- The President and Governors can consider factors beyond legal provisions, such as humanitarian grounds.
The SC Verdict on Remission
1. Obligation of States to Consider Remission: The SC ruled that states must consider remission for eligible
convicts under their remission policies and should not wait for convicts to apply for remission. Failing to exercise discretion in granting remission would violate Article 14 (Right to Equality) of the Indian Constitution.
1. Distinction from Past Judgments: The court reconsidered its rulings in Sangeet v. State of Haryana (2013) and
Mohinder Singh v. State of Punjab (2013), which required an application for remission. It noted that these cases did not address situations where a government policy mandates remission. The ruling emphasized that some state prison manuals require prison officials to initiate remission proceedings.
1. Mandatory Remission Policies by States: It directed all states to create a comprehensive remission policy
within two months if they do not already have one providing clear eligibility criteria for remission.
1. Guidelines for Remission Conditions: The court set guidelines to ensure remission conditions are fair and
reasonable i.e. the guidelines-
- Must consider the motive of the crime, criminal background, and public safety.
- Should focus on rehabilitation and preventing repeat offenses.
VAJIRAM AND RAVI The Recitals (February 2025) Page 64

---
## Page 66

- Must not be overly strict or vague, making remission unattainable.
- Should be reasonable and enforceable.
1. Protection Against Arbitrary Cancellation of Remission: Referring to Mafabhai Motibhai Sagar v. State of
Gujarat (2024), the court ruled that remission should not be automatically canceled for minor breaches.
Convicts must be given notice explaining the reasons for the cancellation and must have the opportunity to respond before the state revokes their remission.
Implications of SC Verdict on Remission
1. Increased Accountability for State Governments: as States will now have to proactively review all eligible cases
under existing remission policies and the States without a remission policy will have to formulate one. This will ensure uniform application across the country.
1. More Structured, fair and Transparent Remission Process: In Bilkis Bano case (2022), remission was granted
selectively, raising concerns over bias and arbitrary decision-making. The ruling eliminates the possibility of arbitrary without considering individual eligibility.
1. Better Rehabilitation and Reintegration of Convicts: Now the remission could not be denied based on vague
or excessively strict conditions that convicts cannot reasonably meet. Prison authorities will be encouraged to focus on behavioral reform, vocational training, and counseling to facilitate eligibility for remission.
✓ Example: Programs in Tihar Jail, Delhi, where prisoners engage in skill development and earn degrees, could be expanded nationally.
1. Protection of Convicts' Rights: This prevents misuse of remission revocation as a punitive tool. Minor or trivial
breaches will not automatically lead to cancellation, ensuring a fairer approach to discipline.
1. Strengthening Judicial Oversight: The judgment reinforces that remission policies must align with
constitutional principles of fairness and equality. Courts may intervene if remission is denied arbitrarily or if conditions imposed are unreasonable. This strengthens judicial review over remission policies.
1. Impact on Prison Administration: It places greater responsibility on prison authorities to assess convicts'
eligibility based on objective criteria and encourages better prison management, as remission incentivizes good behavior and rehabilitation efforts.
1. Uniformity in Remission Policies Across India: Since all states must establish exhaustive remission policies,
disparities in how remission is granted will reduce. The verdict will ensure a consistent approach to premature release of convicts across different states, making the system more predictable and fairer.
1. Impact on Prison Overcrowding: India’s prisons are severely overcrowded, with a 131.4% occupancy rate
(5,73,220 inmates against a capacity of 4,36,266) according to National Crime Records Bureau data from 2022.
This ruling on remission could help reduce overcrowding, but its impact may be limited since 75.8% of inmates are undertrials who are not eligible for remission.
Maharashtra Protection of Interest of Depositors (MPID) Act, 1999 Mumbai Police’s Economic Offences Wing (EOW) will auction seized assets under the MPID Act, aiming to return ₹40 crore to defrauded investors in the Torres Ponzi scam within six months. The MPID Act facilitates asset attachment and distribution in fraud cases.
Case Background
- Fraudulent Investment Schemes: Torres allegedly ran schemes requiring investors to buy jewellery, promising
exorbitant weekly interest rates (up to 500% annually). The company enticed investors with incentives like iPhones, jewellery, luxury bags, cars, and apartments.
- Sudden Halt in Payments: In December 2024, all payments ceased, triggering panic and complaints and
resulting in thousands protesting outside Torres outlets in Mumbai.
VAJIRAM AND RAVI The Recitals (February 2025) Page 65

## Page 67

- EOW Investigation: Mumbai Police’s EOW uncovered the Ponzi-style fraud, leading to asset seizures and legal
action under the MPID Act.
About MPID Act, 1999 The MPID Act, 1999 was enacted to protect investors from fraudulent financial establishments that lure people especially from middle-class and poor backgrounds with high returns and then default on payments.
Key Provisions of the Act
1. Liability for Fraudulent Default: Any financial establishment that fails to repay deposits or promised benefits
(interest, bonus, profit) is liable under the Act. Promoters, partners, directors, managers, and employees involved in the fraud can be held responsible.
1. Penalty: If convicted, those involved may face up to six years of imprisonment and a fine up to ₹1 lakh.
1. Attachment and Sale of Assets: It empowers the government to attach assets of fraudulent financial firms,
with courts finalizing the attachment. Once confirmed, courts can order asset sales for equitable distribution among depositors. Its swift process sets it apart from traditional criminal fraud laws.
Legal Challenges and Supreme Court Rulings
- 2005: The Bombay High Court (HC) declared the MPID Act unconstitutional, stating that it conflicted with
central laws like the Companies Act, 1956 and RBI Act, 1934.
- 2011: Supreme Court (SC) overturned the HC ruling, holding the MPID Act constitutionally valid. It ruled that:
o Fraudulent firms covered under the Act did not have RBI licenses.
o The central laws did not regulate such fraudulent financial establishments.
o MPID Act provides a speedy & effective remedy for depositors, unlike long-drawn conventional legal proceedings.
- 2022: The SC reaffirmed the validity of the MPID Act.
Blocking of Tamil Magazine “Vikatan” The Vikatan website became inaccessible on February 15 after BJP Tamil Nadu chief complained to Information & Broadcasting (I&B) Minister about a cartoon of Prime Minister (PM) Modi and Trump. The magazine and CM M.K.
Stalin condemned it as an attack on free expression.
Background
- Cartoon Depiction: The February 10 edition of Vikatan Plus featured a cartoon of PM Narendra Modi shackled
in chains, seated next to former U.S. President Donald Trump.
- Context: The shackling symbolized the plight of Indian migrants deported from the U.S. in chains aboard
military planes.
- Political Reaction: BJP Tamil Nadu chief escalated the issue, writing to the Ministry of I&B, alleging Vikatan was
biased and acting as a DMK mouthpiece.
- Censorship Concerns: Following the complaint, Vikatan’s website became inaccessible, leading to criticism of
the move as an attack on press freedom.
o Growing Trend of Digital Censorship: The blocking of an entire website rather than specific content reflects the challenges of internet governance and regulation.
How Was Vikatan’s Website Rendered Unavailable?
- Blocking: The Ministry of I&B instructed the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) to relay the order to
internet providers and telecom operators, rendering the site inaccessible under Section 69A of IT Act, 2000.
Blocking orders were confidential- neither Vikatan nor the public received a copy.
VAJIRAM AND RAVI The Recitals (February 2025) Page 66

## Page 68

o Websites facing a block order should receive prior notice allowing them to present their case to a review committee.
o Section 69A of IT Act, 2000 allows the government to block websites in the interest of sovereignty, security, public order, or relations with foreign states. But the SC in Shreya Singhal v. Union of India (2015), emphasized that blocking orders should follow due process and transparency. The lack of prior notice to Vikatan raises concerns about procedural fairness.
Blocking Procedure Under IT Rules, 2009: Ministries and State governments submit blocking requests through a nodal officer. A committee under the IT Ministry reviews the request and decides. If approved, the DoT directs telecom operators to enforce the block.
Difference from Content Removal Rules (IT Rules, 2021): Content removal (social media/streaming services) is governed by the IT Rules, 2021, allowing emergency blocking orders for specific content. However, due to HTTPS encryption, specific content within a website cannot be blocked without cooperation from the publisher—only entire domains can be restricted.
- Post-Blocking Process: On February 16, Vikatan received a notice under the 2021 IT Rules, but this notice did
not acknowledge the website's full inaccessibility.
What can Vikatan do now?
- Appeal: Vikatan presented its case during a hearing on February 20 to a review committee, as per the I&B
Ministry’s notice. If the review committee upholds the block, Vikatan can challenge the decision in the High Court (HC). Similar cases, like VLC Media Player in 2022, resulted in unblocking after discussions with the IT Ministry.
- Legal Challenge: Vikatan has vowed to challenge the order if the outcome does not align with press freedom
principles.
Implications of the Government Blocking Vikatan’s Website
1. Press Freedom & Censorship Concerns: The blocking of Vikatan without prior notice raises concerns over press
freedom and government overreach. It sets a precedent for silencing critical media through administrative orders, bypassing judicial scrutiny.
1. Lack of Transparency in Website Blocking: Blocking orders under Section 69A of the IT Act are confidential,
limiting public awareness and accountability. Vikatan received no prior notice, violating due process under the 2009 IT Blocking Rules and violating principles of natural justice.
1. Potential Legal and Judicial Scrutiny: If Vikatan challenges the order in court, it could lead to a judicial review
of the government's blocking powers. The case might set legal precedents on how such censorship is applied to the news media.
1. Chilling Effect on Media & Digital Platforms: The incident could intimidate other media houses, discouraging
them from publishing critical content against the government. Digital platforms may self-censor to avoid being blocked, affecting free speech online.
✓ Digital platforms, depend on internet access. Blocking their websites affects their reach, revenue, and credibility.
1. International Reputation & Democratic Values: India's global image as a democracy may suffer if media
censorship continues. It could invite international criticism from press freedom organizations like Reporters Without Borders.
✓ India ranked 159th out of 180 nations in the 2024 Press Freedom Index by Reporters Without Borders.
Legal Action Against Amazon Web Services (AWS) Bengaluru-based Adarsh Developers has filed a complaint against Amazon Web Services (AWS) over the loss of years’ worth of company and customer data, leading to a financial loss exceeding ₹100 crores. The case raises VAJIRAM AND RAVI The Recitals (February 2025) Page 67

---
## Page 69

concerns about cloud storage security, data backup practices, and legal accountability in enterprise cloud services.
Background
- Adarsh Developers filed an FIR on February 11 against AWS after its entire SAP S/4HANA environment was
deleted on January 9, 2025, leading to estimated losses of ₹150 crores.
- The company alleges that AWS representatives advised an upgrade for security in May 2023, but its financial,
customer, and operational data was later erased, disrupting business completely.
- AWS has denied Adarsh Developers’ allegations, stating it "operated as designed" and was "not responsible"
for the data deletion. AWS also informed Adarsh that the data could not be restored, prompting legal action.
- A case has been registered under the Information Technology (IT) Act and sections on fraud and impersonation
under the Bhartiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS).
✓ Section 43A of the BNS also provides for compensation to be paid to the affected users by the corporate body for failure to protect sensitive personal information causing wrongful gain or wrongful loss to any person.
✓ Section 72A of BNS: Punishment for disclosure of personal information in breach of lawful contract.
✓ Section 66 of the Information Technology Act (IT Act) in India primarily covers acts related to hacking and data destruction, meaning that anyone who dishonestly or fraudulently performs any act mentioned in Section 43 of the IT Act (which includes unauthorized access to computer systems, data modification, and destruction) can be considered liable under this section.
What might be the Reasons for Missing Data?
- Data loss can result from malicious attacks, human error, or cloud misconfiguration such as poor security
settings, bad system architecture, or unmanaged access.
- Adarsh Developers' FIR cites SAVIC’s claim that individuals from Redington and AWS deleted the account at
the root level.
- However, a forensic investigation is needed to determine the exact cause and responsibility, requiring all
involved parties—Adarsh, Redington, SAVIC, and AWS—to provide technical evidence.
Jurisprudence on Cloud Data Security
- If the case proceeds to higher courts, it may set precedents for cloud service liability in India.
- Questions such as "Who is responsible for data loss—client, vendor, or cloud provider?" may be clarified.
- Global Parallel: In Google Italy v. Vivi Down (2010), Google was held accountable for failing to prevent privacy
violations on its platform.
Electronic Personnel License (EPL) Recently, the Civil Aviation Ministry launched Electronic Personnel License (EPL) for pilots, making India the second country after China to implement this digital system, enhancing aviation safety, security, and efficiency.
About EPL The EPL implementation by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) supports the government's Ease of Doing Business and Digital India Initiative. It simplifies licensing processes and enhances digital governance in aviation.
Key Features
- Digital Replacement for Physical Licenses: EPL is a digital version of a personnel license that will replace
traditional physical licenses for pilots. It enhances accessibility and security by eliminating the need for paper- based documentation.
VAJIRAM AND RAVI The Recitals (February 2025) Page 68

---
## Page 70

✓ In 2011, India’s DGCA discovered fake pilot licenses, leading to stricter verification measures. EPL reduces such risks by enabling real-time digital authentication.
- Secure Access via eGCA Mobile Application: Pilots can access their licenses securely through the eGCA Mobile
Application. This ensures a seamless, transparent, and efficient licensing process.
- Compliance with ICAO Standards: The introduction of EPL follows International Civil Aviation Organization’s
(ICAO) Amendment 178 to Annex 1 – Personnel Licensing. This amendment encourages Member States to adopt electronic licenses for enhanced security and efficiency.
About the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) ICAO (headquartered in Montreal, Canada) is an intergovernmental specialized agency associated with the United Nations (UN), established in 1947 under the Convention on International Civil Aviation (1944), also known as the Chicago Convention.
✓ India was one of the founding members of ICAO. ICAO has 193 member states, facilitating global cooperation in aviation. India was re-elected to the ICAO Council for the 2022–2025 term Functions of ICAO
- Ensuring Safe and Efficient Air Transport: It develops safe and efficient international air transport for
peaceful purposes and ensures equal opportunities for all countries to operate international airlines.
✓ ICAO's No Country Left Behind (NCLB) initiative helps developing nations modernize air transport.
- Setting Global Aviation Standards: It establishes standards and regulations for:
o Aviation safety and security. MH370 mystery (2014) led to improved tracking requirements for aircraft.
o Economic development of the aviation sector.
o Environmental performance improvements in aviation. Focus on reducing aviation’s carbon footprint via Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA).
o In 2022, ICAO member states agreed to a long-term goal of net-zero carbon emissions from aviation by
1. 
- Promoting International Cooperation: It acts as a clearinghouse for discussions and cooperation on civil
aviation issues among member states. It plays a key role in airspace sovereignty disputes, such as between China and Taiwan or India and Pakistan.
- Liberalizing Aviation Markets: It encourages regional and international agreements to promote open
and competitive aviation markets. Eg. India-US Open Skies Agreement (2005) allows unrestricted flights between the two nations.
Article 371A A Meghalaya regional party has suggested that bringing the State under Article 371 could help lift the 2014 ban on rat-hole coal mining. Article 371 grants special provisions to certain states. It cited Nagaland’s Article 371A, which protects land, resources, and customary laws, as a model for Meghalaya.
✓ Rat-hole mining is a crude, unscientific and hazardous method of coal extraction involving small tunnels, typically 3-4 feet deep, which workers must crawl through to mine coal. It is commonly practiced in Meghalaya despite being banned by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in April 2014 due to its environmental and safety hazards.
What is Article 371A?
The state of Nagaland was carved out of Assam in 1963 as a result of 16-point agreement between the Naga People’s Convention and the Union of India.
- Parliamentary Laws & Naga Autonomy: No Act of Parliament applies to Nagaland regarding:
VAJIRAM AND RAVI The Recitals (February 2025) Page 69

---
## Page 71

o Religious or social practices of the Nagas.
o Customary laws and procedures, including civil and criminal justice.
o Ownership and transfer of land and resources.
o Unless Nagaland’s Legislative Assembly passes a resolution to accept it.
- Land Ownership: Non-residents cannot buy land in Nagaland, ensuring protection of indigenous rights and
resources.
Significance of Article 371A
- Protection of Naga Identity & Culture: It safeguards traditional customs, social practices, and customary
laws of the Naga people and ensures that Nagaland's distinct tribal heritage and governance remain untouched by national laws unless approved by the State Assembly.
✓ Naga customary courts handle civil and criminal cases within their communities, limiting the reach of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).
- Autonomy in Lawmaking: The Nagaland Legislative Assembly has the power to accept or reject
Parliamentary laws related to religious practices, land ownership, and customary laws. Thus, providing self- governance and greater control over legal matters affecting the state.
✓ Nagaland's stance on UCC (Uniform Civil Code): Many Naga groups oppose UCC as it might override their tribal customs.
- Land and Resource Protection: It ensures that tribal land and resources remain under local ownership and
preserves natural resources from external exploitation.
- Special Responsibility of the Governor: The Governor has discretionary powers over law and order, ensuring
stability while maintaining the state's unique status. However, this provision has also led to tensions over autonomy between the state government and the Centre.
✓ In 2020, Nagaland demanded the removal of AFSPA, but the Centre continued its enforcement under Governor’s authority.
- Influence on Other States: It sets a precedent for other Northeastern states seeking special constitutional
protections, influencing provisions in states like Arunachal Pradesh (371H), Manipur (371C), and Mizoram
## (371G).
✓ The Inner Line Permit (ILP) system in Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, and Manipur follows Nagaland’s model of restricting non-resident entry.
- Political and Administrative Stability: It helps maintain peace and stability by addressing the historical
demands of Naga groups for autonomy and plays a role in ongoing negotiations for a permanent Naga political settlement.

## ECONOMY
Changing Employment Sector in India
- India’s middle class after Independence was largely created by the public sector.
- Employment in the public sector stood at 194.7 lakh and that in the organised private sector only at 80.6
lakh in 1995.
- The former — employees in the central and state governments plus quasi-governments (public sector
undertakings) and local bodies — fell to 176.1 lakh and the latter rose to 119.7 lakh by 2012.
- The Ministry of Labour & Employment has not compiled or released statistics on organised public and
private sector employment after 2011-12 (April-March).
- Even the data last published in the Finance Ministry’s Economic Survey for 2018-19 stops at 2011-12.
Middle Class 2.0
- However, the trend of organised employment
shifting from the public to private sector — especially post the economic reforms of 1991 — has grown after 2011-12.
- One indicator is the number of regular employees
with the Indian Railways, which dropped from 16.5 lakh to 11.9 lakh between 1990-91 and 2022-23
- The reduction in employment with Central public
sector enterprises is even sharper, from 22.2 lakh in 1990-91 to just over 8.1 lakh in 2023-24.
- On the other hand, the IT industry rose as the
symbol of India’s post-reform “second middle class”.
- Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Infosys already
had 45,714 and 36,750 employees respectively at the end of 2004-05, which rose to 4,48,464 and 2,42,371 fifteen years later.
- However, the real rise took place after Covid-19. As the pandemic triggered increased demand for
digitisation even among businesses that were slow in adoption.
- It had a beneficial impact on India’s exports of software services and also employment in IT companies.
- The total headcount in the big-five firms — TCS, Infosys, Wipro, HCL Technologies and Tech Mahindra —
went up from below 11.5 lakh in end-March 2020 to above 16 lakh in end-September 2022.
- Although the numbers have dipped slightly since - 15,34,708 employees as on December 31, 2024. That’s
more than the 12,52,180 regular employees with the Indian Railways.
- It is also more than the currently estimated 14.2 lakh officers, soldiers, airmen and sailors in the three
defence services.
Banking Sector Transformation
- Another, Middle Class 2.0 story is the banking industry. In 1991-92. Public sector banks (PSBs) had an 87%
share of nearly 8.5 lakh in scheduled commercial banks
- The period of 2022-23 was a landmark, when private sector banks, for the first time, overtook their state-
owned counterparts in employment.
- By end of 2023-24, their employee strength was 8.74 lakh compared to 7.5 lakh of public sector banks.
VAJIRAM AND RAVI The Recitals (February 2025) Page 71

## Page 73

Employment Challenge
- Simply put, liberalisation and globalisation opened up new industries and opportunities for private
enterprise. That, in turn, led to significant employment generation.
- The private sector-led Middle Class 2.0’s expansion happened just when the post-Independence
government-created Middle Class 1.0 started shrinking with the initiation of reforms.
- This job generation, however, has had a major limitation. It has mainly been in services.
- India, unlike China and most industrialised countries, has not experienced “structural transformation”
involving the large-scale transfer of surplus labour from agriculture to sectors — particularly manufacturing and modern services — where productivity (output value per worker) and average incomes are higher.
- Official Periodic Labour Force Surveys (PLFS) show the farm sector’s share in India’s workforce decreasing
from 64% in 1993-94 to 48.9% in 2011-12 and further to 42.5% in 2018-19 but subsequently going up to
1. 2% in 2023-24.
- Manufacturing’s share climbed initially from 10.4% in 1993-94 to 12.6% in 2011-12, only to come down to
1. 4% in 2023-24.
- The latest 2023-24 PLFS report reveals the 11.4% share of manufacturing in the total employed labour force
to be below that of construction (12%), trade, hotel & restaurants (12.2%) and “other services” (11.9%).
- Thus, while the services sector has expanded, with India even becoming a “back office to the world” (like
China is its “factory”), the well-paying jobs have been more for the better educated.
- And not everyone can be a software programmer, doctor, financial analyst, accountant or lawyer. Most
services sector jobs are informal and low paying: Construction and headload labour, sanitation, security staffing, domestic help, shop assistant and gig work.
- But these jobs cannot, beyond a point, get people to join the Middle Class 2.0 and this is India’s real
employment challenge.
Income-tax Bill, 2025 The Income-tax Bill, 2025 was recently introduced in Lok Sabha. It intends to simplify India’s six-decade-old structure of direct taxation by streamlining provisions, removing obsolete references, and creating a crisper and simpler legal framework. The simplification exercise is guided by three core principles:
- Textual and structural simplification for improved clarity and coherence.
- No major tax policy changes to ensure continuity and certainty.
- No modifications of tax rates, preserving predictability for taxpayers.
Qualitative Improvements
- Consolidation of amendments, reducing fragmentation.
- Removal of obsolete and redundant
provisions
- Structural rationalization through tables
and formulae for improved readability.
Aspects of the Bill
- The Bill is 622 pages long, about 24%
shorter than the 823-page Income-tax Act (updated until 2024). There are 23 chapters. There are 16 schedules, two more than in the Act.
VAJIRAM AND RAVI The Recitals (February 2025) Page 72

---
## Page 74

- And all redundant provisions, including those for capital gains, deductions, and dispute resolution that have
seen amendments over the years, omitted.
Concept of Tax Year
- The Bill introduces the concept of “tax year” (instead of assessment year), which has been defined as the 12-
month period beginning April 1. Income tax will be levied on the basis of the economic activity and income earned in a tax year.
- In case of a business or a newly-set-up profession, the tax year will begin from the date it was set up and will
end with the said financial year.
- At present, income tax has the concept of “assessment year” (AY), which assesses tax on income earned in
the “previous (financial) year”.
Social Media Access
- “Virtual digital space” has been defined in the powers to call for information by income tax authorities
during surveys, searches and seizures.
- This will include email servers, social media accounts, online investment, trading and banking accounts,
remote or cloud servers, and digital application platforms.
Crypto as Property
- Virtual digital assets such as cryptocurrencies have been included in the definition of property to be counted
as a capital asset of the assessee.
- This is in addition to existing categories of immovable property such as land and building, shares and
securities, bullion, jewellery, archaeological collections, drawings, paintings, sculptures, and any work of art.
Dispute Resolution
- The section on Dispute Resolution Panel (DRP) in the Bill provides the points of determination, decision, and
the reasons behind it, marking a shift from the earlier section, which lacked clarity on the manner of issuing DRP directions.
Mutual Credit Guarantee Scheme for MSMEs
- The Centre has approved the Mutual Credit Guarantee Scheme for MSMEs (MCGS-MSME) to provide loan
guarantee coverage by National Credit Guarantee Trustee Company Limited (NCGTC) to Member Lending Institutions (MLIs).
o NCGTC was established in 2014, under the Indian Companies Act, 1956, with a paid-up capital of Rs 10 crore. It is a private limited company that is fully owned by Govt. of India and operates under the Department of Financial Services, Ministry of Finance.
- The scheme aims to strengthen the manufacturing sector by facilitating collateral free loans by banks and
financial institutions to MSMEs who are in need of debt capital for their expansion and growth.
- MLIs include All Scheduled
Commercial Banks (SCBs), Non- Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) and All India Financial institutions (AIFIs) that register with NCGTC under the scheme.
Impact
- Manufacturing sector, currently
contributes 17% to the nation’s VAJIRAM AND RAVI The Recitals (February 2025) Page 73

---
## Page 75

GDP and employs over 27.3 million workers.
- As global supply chains shift, India is emerging as an alternative supply source due to its raw materials, low
labour costs, growing manufacturing knowhow, and entrepreneurial ability.
- The scheme addresses the industry’s long-standing need for collateral-free loans, enabling MSMEs to
expand their capacities and drive economic growth.
Swavalambini Programme
- The Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE), in collaboration with NITI Aayog has
launched Swavalambini - a Women Entrepreneurship Programme - in Assam, Meghalaya and Mizoram.
- It is aimed at empowering female students in select Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) in the northeast.
- The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 has laid the foundation for an entrepreneurship-driven curriculum
by emphasising skill integration, industry collaboration, and hands-on experience.
- Swalambini will build on this framework, ensuring that young women particularly in North-Eastern states
receive the necessary guidance and financial backing to transform their ideas into scalable businesses.
- To this end, MSDE through Indian Institute of Entrepreneurship (IIE) along with NITI Aayog will provide a
structured stage-wise entrepreneurial process—from awareness to development, mentorship, and funding support.
Components of the Programme
- It will provide structured training through the Entrepreneurship Awareness Programme (EAP) which
introduces 600 female students to entrepreneurship as a viable career option.
o EAP will be a 2-day session covering basic entrepreneurial concepts.
- Further, 300 students will be selected for the Women Entrepreneurship Development Programme (EDP).
o EDP offers an intensive 40-hour training covering crucial business aspects such as training and skilling, access to finance, market linkages, compliance and legal support, business services, and networking opportunities.
- This will be followed by six months of mentorship and handholding support to help participants translate
their ideas into sustainable prospects.
- It will also utilise workshops, mentoring support, and seed funding to create sustainable women-led
enterprises.
- A unique aspect of the program is the Award to Rewards Initiative, which will celebrate and recognise
successful women entrepreneurs emerging from Swalambini.
- The programme also recognises the critical role of educators in promoting an entrepreneurial mind-set.
- Thus, to upskill the faculty in HEIs, a 5-day Faculty Development Programme (FDP) will be held.
- Faculty members will undergo specialised training modules designed to provide them with latest industry
insights, business incubation strategies, and hands-on coaching techniques.
TEAM Initiative for MSMEs
- The Ministry of MSME, in partnership with the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC), has launched the
MSME Trade Enablement and Marketing (TEAM) Initiative.
- The initiative is aimed to enable MSMEs to embrace digital commerce and expand their market presence. It
will connect MSMEs with the ONDC Network.
VAJIRAM AND RAVI The Recitals (February 2025) Page 74

---
## Page 76

- Budget: Rs 277.35 crore over three years will focus on on-boarding 5 lakh micro and small enterprises, with
50% of these being women-led businesses.
- By providing access to digital storefronts, integrated payment systems, and logistics support, the initiative
aims to reduce operational barriers and help businesses tap into wider customer bases.
- Beyond these tools, it
emphasizes formalizing operations and establishing digital transaction histories, which will enhance the credibility and trust of participating MSMEs.
- To ease the transition to
digital commerce, financial assistance will be provided to Seller Network Participants to facilitate catalogue creation, operations and account management.
- Over 150 workshops will
be held across Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, targeting key MSME clusters, with special attention to women and SC/ST-led enterprises.
- By working along with existing government programs like PM Vishwakarma and the Digital MSME scheme,
the TEAM Initiative offers a comprehensive approach to address the needs of small businesses in today’s rapidly evolving economy.
India’s Single Largest Solar Cell Manufacturing Unit
- India’s single largest photovoltaic solar cell and module manufacturing unit was inaugurated at
Gangaikondan SIPCOT Industrial Growth Centre, Tirunelveli, Tamil Nadu.
- Set up by TP Solar Limited (TATA Power’s solar energy manufacturing arm), with an investment of ₹3,800
crore, the facility is India’s largest integrated solar manufacturing unit at a single location having an annual capacity of 4.3 GW.
- The unit would also manufacture some of the raw materials for module manufacturing and will provide
employment to over 4,000 people, including an 80% female workforce.
Beggar-Thy-Neighbour (BTN) Policies
- BTN policies refer to protectionist economic policies adopted by governments that are aimed at benefiting
a country’s economy at the expense of other countries.
- A trade war in which a government imposes heavy “tariffs” and strict “quotas” on the import of foreign
goods into the country is the most common example of BTN policies.
VAJIRAM AND RAVI The Recitals (February 2025) Page 75

---
## Page 77

- Central banks of countries also engage in such policies through currency wars, in which they “depreciate the
value of their domestic currencies” against foreign currencies to boost their domestic exports and to discourage the import of foreign goods.
- Higher
exports and lower imports, in turn, are expected to lead to a trade surplus which is believed to be good for the domestic economy.
Criticism of BTN Policies
- Critics, however, believe that BTN policies can make all countries poorer, particularly when countries begin
to retaliate against each other by imposing tit-for-tat tariffs and currency devaluations.
- Such tit-for-tat policies were implemented most notably during the period between the two major World
Wars. Retaliatory tariffs and competitive currency devaluations during the period led to a significant drop in global trade and investment.
- In fact, economic historians consider such protectionist policies to be one of the major reasons behind the
Great Depression that affected countries across the globe.
- In recent decades, countries such as China and Japan have been accused of devaluing their currencies to
help their exporters, and to achieve a trade surplus with other major economies such as the United States.
- The tariffs and other trade barriers imposed recently in the US will negatively affect American consumers
who will now have to pay higher prices for goods due to reduced foreign supplies.
- Similarly, when a central bank depreciates the exchange value of its currency by flooding the forex market
with its currency, it puts more domestic currency in the hands of foreigners, thus reducing the purchasing power of domestic consumers.
- Critics also argue that countries should not retaliate when a foreign country imposes tariffs or other trade
barriers on their exporters or devalues its currency in order to favour its own domestic exporters.
- For example, while U.S. tariffs would hurt Chinese producers, imposing retaliatory tariffs against U.S. goods
will only make things worse for China because Chinese consumers will then have to pay more for goods and services imported from the U.S.
- They believe that countries that adopt unilateral free trade can avoid the damage caused by retaliatory
tariffs, and in fact even benefit from the protectionist policies of other countries.
Repo Rate Reduced After holding the repo rate at 6.50% for two years, the RBI six-member Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) reduced the repo rate by 25 basis points (bps) to 6.25%. This marks the first repo rate cut in nearly five years Reasons for the Cut
- The RBI’s decision to cut
the repo rate depends on various factors, including inflation, economic growth, and global economic trends.
VAJIRAM AND RAVI The Recitals (February 2025) Page 76

---
## Page 78

- MPC has estimated the GDP growth at 6.7% and projected retail inflation at 4.2% for the fiscal 2025-26.
- Retail inflation i.e. Consumer Price Index (CPI) eased to a four month low of 5.22% in December 2024 from
1. 5% in November 2024. Inflation is within RBI’s target range.
- The main reason behind the rate cut is to stimulate economic growth by making borrowing cheaper for
individuals and businesses, leading to increased spending and investment.
Impact of the Rate Cut
- All external benchmark lending rates (EBLR) — lending rates set by the banks based on external benchmarks
such as the repo rate — will come down by 25 bps.
- Lenders may also reduce interest rates on loans that are linked to the Marginal cost of fund-based lending
rate (MCLR) - the minimum lending rate below which a bank is not allowed to lend.
- A lower repo rate makes borrowing cheaper for individuals and businesses, which can lead to increased
spending and investment, thereby boosting economic growth.
- EMIs on home and vehicle loans will come down.
- With lower interest rates, banks are more likely to lend, making credit more accessible to consumers and
businesses.
- However, a lower repo rate can lead to higher inflation, as increased money supply and lower interest rates
can drive up prices.
- It can reduce the interest earned on savings, making it less attractive for individuals to save.
Market Intervention Scheme (MIS)
- The agriculture ministry has revised the guidelines for Market Intervention Scheme (MIS), to encourage
states to implement the scheme.
- MIS is implemented on the request of State/UT government for procurement of various perishable
agricultural/horticultural commodities such as tomato, onion and potato (TOP) etc. for which Minimum Support Price (MSP) is not applicable.
- The scheme is to ensure farmers are not forced to sell their produce under distress.
Revised Guidelines
- MIS has been made a
component of the integrated scheme of Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay SanraksHan Abhiyan
## (PM-AASHA).
- MIS will be implemented
only when there is a minimum reduction of 10% in the prevailing market price as compared to the previous normal year.
- The revised procurement/coverage limit of production quantity of crops has been increased from the
existing 20% to 25%.
- The State has also been given the option to pay the difference between the Market Intervention Price (MIP)
and the selling price directly into the bank account of the farmers in place of physical procurement.
VAJIRAM AND RAVI The Recitals (February 2025) Page 77

## Page 79

- Further, in case there is a difference in the price of TOP crops between the producing and consuming States,
the operational cost in storage and transportation of crops from the producing State to consuming States will be reimbursed by Central Nodal Agencies like National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India (NAFED) and National Cooperative Consumers Federation (NCCF).
- It is being proposed to include, apart from NAFED and NCCF, farmer producer organisations, farmer
producer companies, state-nominated agencies and other central nodal agencies, to undertake procurement of TOP crops under MIS.
Restructured Skill India Programme
- The Union Cabinet has approved continuation and restructuring of the central sector scheme - Skill India
Programme (SIP) till 2026 with an outlay of Rs 8,800 crore from the period of 2022-23 to 2025-26.
- This approval is aligned with the vision of building a skilled, future-ready workforce by integrating demand-
driven, technology-enabled, and industry-aligned training across the country.
- Following Three components will now be combined under the composite SIP.
Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Pradhan Mantri National Apprenticeship Jan Shikshan Sansthan Yojana 4.0 (PMKVY 4.0) Promotion Scheme (PM-NAPS) (JSS)scheme
- These initiatives aim to provide structured skill development, on-the-job training, and community-based
learning, ensuring that both urban and rural populations, including marginalized communities, have access to high-quality vocational education.
- As a key driver of economic empowerment, SIP contributes to employment generation, entrepreneurship,
and productivity enhancement across sectors.
- Under the three flagships schemes of Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE), there are
more than 2.27 Crore beneficiaries till date.
Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) 4.0
- PMKVY 4.0 provides National Skills Qualifications Framework (NSQF) aligned skill development training
through Short-Term Training (STT).
- It includes Special Projects (SP) and reskilling and upskilling through Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL). Its
target beneficiaries are 15-59 years of age.
- It has undergone transformational changes to make skill development training industry oriented.
- A key shift under the scheme is the integration of On-the-Job Training (OJT) within short-term skilling
programs, ensuring that trainees gain real-world exposure and industry experience.
- To keep pace with evolving industry demands and new age technology, 400+ new courses on AI, 5G
technology, cybersecurity, green hydrogen, drone technology, have been introduced.
- To provide targeted, industry-relevant skills, the program introduces micro-credential and National
Occupational Standards (NoS)-based courses ranging from 7.5 to 30 hours.
- The blended and flexible learning model now includes digital delivery.
- The curriculum is available in multiple regional languages.
- To strengthen quality training and assessments, a national pool of one lakh assessors and trainers is being
developed.
- Industry partnerships ensure access to employment opportunities through Recruit Train Deploy (RTD)
training.

- Additionally, the scheme places a strong emphasis on international mobility, ensuring Indian workers are
equipped with globally recognized skills.
- The MSDE has Migration and Mobility Partnership Agreements (MMPAs) and MoUs with various countries
and has conducted necessary sectorial skill gap studies.
- Under PMKVY 4.0 a whole-of-government approach has been adopted to drive inter-ministerial
convergence, ensuring the seamless execution of skilling initiatives across sectors.
- Key collaborations include PM Vishwakarma under the Ministry of MSME, PM Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana,
and the National Green Hydrogen Mission of the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, NAL JAL Mitra etc.
- A key reform is the Ease of Doing Business approach, which has significantly reduced the compliance
burden, making participation in the scheme more streamlined and efficient.
PM National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme (PM-NAPS)
- Globally, apprenticeship is considered as the best model for skill acquisition and earning while learning.
- The National Policy on Skill Development and Entrepreneurship, 2015 focuses on apprenticeship as one of
the key components for creating skilled manpower in India.
- Apprenticeship training can play a major role for on-the-job vocational training where youth can acquire
skills by working at actual workplace and earn some stipend, as financial support.
- PM-NAPS supports seamless transition from education to work, ensuring apprentices gain industry-specific
skills through real-world exposure. The scheme is designed for individuals aged 14 to 35 years.
- To support both apprentices and establishments in India, 25% of the stipend, up to Rs.1,500 per month per
apprentice, is provided by the Central Government.
- NAPS encourages apprenticeship opportunities in emerging fields such as AI, robotics, blockchain, green
energy, and Industry 4.0 technologies.
- It also encourages enrolment of apprentices in small establishments especially MSMEs, and those located in
the underserved areas such as aspirational districts & North-East Region.
Jan Shikshan Sansthan (JSS) Scheme
- JSS scheme is a community-centric skilling initiative designed to make vocational training accessible, flexible,
and inclusive, particularly for women, rural youth, and economically disadvantaged groups. It caters to the age group of 15 -45 years.
- By delivering low-cost, doorstep training with flexible schedules, JSS ensures that skilling opportunities reach
those who need them the most, facilitating both self-employment and wage-based livelihoods.
- Beyond skill development, the program plays a vital role in social empowerment, creating awareness on
health, hygiene, financial literacy, gender equality, and education within communities.
- JSS is linked with key initiatives of the government like: Pradhan Mantri Janjati Adivasi Nyaya Maha AbhiyaN
(PM JANMAN), Understanding of Lifelong Learning for All in Society (ULLAS), etc. to promote inclusive skilling.
HS Code for GI Rice Varieties
- The Customs Tariff Act was recently amended to provide for an HS (Harmonised System) code for the export
of Geographical Indication (GI) recognised rice.
- It is the first time in the world that an HS code has been introduced for GI-recognised rice.
- The Indian Patent Office has given a GI tag to 20 rice varieties:

Plans To Raise Deposit Insurance Cover The government is considering increasing the insurance cover for bank deposits from the current limit of Rs 5 lakh.
Deposit Insurance
- Deposit insurance offers protection to the deposits of bank customers in case of a bank insolvency (bank
failure). A bank becomes insolvent when its total liabilities exceed its total assets, usually as a result of poor investing or lending decisions.
- So, an insolvent bank may not be able to repay all the money that it owes its depositors. In such cases, the
government steps in to compensate depositors, usually up to a certain threshold amount.
- Each depositor in a bank is insured up to a maximum of Rs 5 lakh for both principal and interest amount held
by them as on the date of liquidation or failure of a bank.
- The insurance cover of Rs 5 lakh per depositor is for all accounts held by the depositor in all branches of the
insured bank.
- Deposits in public and private sector banks, local area banks, small finance banks, regional rural banks,
cooperative banks, Indian branches of foreign banks and payments banks are all insured by the DICGC.
However, primary cooperative societies are not insured by the DICGC.
- The premium for deposit insurance is borne by the insured bank. DICGC (Deposit Insurance and Credit
Guarantee Corporation) collects premiums from member financial institutions at a flat or differentiated rate based on the bank’s risk profile.
- DICGC is a wholly owned subsidiary of the RBI.
- The DICGC insures all deposits such as savings, fixed, current, recurring, etc. except the following:
o Deposits of foreign Governments; o Deposits of Central/State Governments; o Inter-bank deposits; o Deposits of State Land Development Banks with the State co-operative bank; o Any amount due on account of and deposit received outside India; VAJIRAM AND RAVI The Recitals (February 2025) Page 80

---
## Page 82

o Any amount, specifically exempted by the corporation with the previous approval of RBI.
Increase in the Cover
- The deposit insurance scheme was started in 1962; the number of insured banks was 1,997 as of March 31,
1. 
- The coverage has so far been enhanced six times from Rs 1,500 to Rs 5 lakh now. Last time it was raised
from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 5 lakh in February 2020.
- As of March 31, 2024, fully protected accounts were 97.8% of the total, higher than the international
benchmark of 80%.
- However, considering multiple factors like growth in the value of bank deposits, economic growth rate,
inflation, increase in income levels etc., a periodical upward revision of this limit may be necessary.
Sovereign Green Bonds Like several emerging markets, India has also turned to sovereign green bonds (SGrBs) to help fund its transition to a low-carbon economy, but investor demand remains weak.
Green Bonds
- Green bonds are debt instruments issued by governments, corporations, and multilateral banks to raise
funds for projects that reduce emissions or enhance climate resilience.
- Issuers typically offer green bonds at lower yields than conventional bonds, assuring investors that the
proceeds will be used exclusively for green investments.
- The difference in yield — known as the green premium, or greenium — determines the cost advantage of
green bonds. A higher greenium allows issuers to raise funds at lower costs, making green investments more attractive.
- Investors in green bonds often seek stable, long-term returns.
- Despite their potential, green bonds constitute a small part of the debt market and overall climate financing,
as governments strengthen reporting practices and introduce incentives to attract investors.
Sovereign Green Bonds in India
- SGrBs are green bonds that are issued by sovereign entities, like the Indian government, which formulated a
framework for issuing SGrBs in 2022.
- The framework defines “green projects” as those that encourage energy efficiency in resource utilisation,
reduce carbon emissions, promote climate resilience, and improve natural ecosystems.
- Since 2022-23, India has issued SGrBs eight times, and raised almost Rs 53,000 crore. Each year, the
government uses roughly 50% of proceeds from SGrBs to fund production of energy efficient three-phase electric locomotives through the Ministry of Railways.
- For 2024-25, the revised estimates for allocations to schemes eligible under SGrBs include Rs 12,600 crore
for electric locomotive manufacturing.
- Further, around Rs 8,000 crore for metro projects, Rs 4,607 crore for renewable energy projects, including
the National Green Hydrogen Mission, and Rs 124 crore for afforestation under the National Mission for a Green India.
Low Demand in India
- While globally greeniums have reached 7-8 basis points, in India it is often at just 2–3 basis points. This limits
the expansion of SGrBs as a viable funding source.
- A key challenge is liquidity. Small issue sizes and investors holding bonds until maturity have led to limited
secondary market trading, reducing their appeal.
VAJIRAM AND RAVI The Recitals (February 2025) Page 81

---
## Page 83

- Additionally, India lacks a strong ecosystem of social impact funds and responsible investing mandates,
which in other markets drive green bond demand.
Impact of Low Demand
- The government’s inability to raise adequate proceeds from SGrBs impacts funding for schemes eligible
under it and increases pressure on general revenue to meet the shortfall.
- Initially, the estimated funding requirement from SGrB proceeds for 2024-25 stood at Rs 32,061 crore.
- However, after unsuccessful attempts to sell SGrBs due to higher yields cited by investors, the revised
estimate has been lowered to Rs 25,298 crore.
- As a result, planned allocations for key schemes have been reduced. For example, allocation for a scheme
promoting grid-scale solar projects has been reduced from Rs 10,000 crore to Rs 1,300 crore.
- The total expenditure in the current financial year will be made against expected proceeds amounting to Rs
21,697 crore, and to bridge the shortfall, roughly Rs 3,600 crore will be drawn from the government’s general revenue.
Way forward
- According to a recent World Bank report, emerging market sovereign issuers tend to issue more bonds that
finance a combination of green and social projects compared to advanced market sovereign issuers, which mostly issue green bonds.
- In other words, bonds for projects that combine green and social projects, also known as sustainability
bonds, could boost investor interest and increase proceeds from issues.
- The report also noted that sovereigns take considerable time to prepare the post-issuance allocation and
impact report, which impacts investor interest.
- The Department of Economic Affairs, which oversees allocation of proceeds, hasn’t yet published the
allocation report for 2023-24.
- Addressing liquidity issues, improving reporting transparency, and exploring sustainability bonds could help
boost demand and expand green finance in the country.
Makhana Board Union Budget announced that a Makhana Board will be set up in Bihar to boost its cultivation and marketing.
Makhana
- Makhana, also known as fox nut, is the dried edible seed of the prickly water lily or gorgon plant
(Euryale ferox). This plant is found in freshwater ponds throughout South and East Asia.
- It is recognized for its violet and white flowers, as well as its large, round, and prickly leaves.
- The edible part of the Makhana plant consists of small, round seeds that have an outer layer ranging
from black to brown. Thus, it is also known as the Black Diamond.
- After processing, these seeds are often consumed as popped snacks known as ‘lava.’ Makhana is
highly nutritious and provides an excellent source of carbohydrates, protein, and minerals. Due to its versatile applications in medicine, healthcare, and nutrition, this plant can be consumed in various forms.
Cultivation
- Bihar accounts for approximately 90% of India’s makhana production.
- The production is primarily concentrated in nine districts located in northern and eastern Bihar:
Darbhanga, Madhubani, Purnea, Katihar, Saharsa, Supaul, Araria, Kishanganj, and Sitamarhi, which are part of the Mithilanchal region.
VAJIRAM AND RAVI The Recitals (February 2025) Page 82

---
## Page 84

- Among these districts, the first four contribute to 80% of Bihar’s total makhana output. In 2022, ‘Mithila
Makhana’ was conferred a GI tag.
- In addition to Bihar, makhana is cultivated in smaller quantities in the states of Assam, Manipur, West
Bengal, Tripura, and Odisha, as well as in neighboring countries like Nepal, Bangladesh, China, Japan, and Korea.
Climatic Conditions for Makhana Cultivation
- Makhana is an aquatic crop and is mainly grown in tropical and subtropical regions. It is traditionally
cultivated in stagnant water bodies such as ponds, land depressions, lakes, ditches, or wetlands with shallow water depths of up to 4-6 feet.
- For optimal growth and development, Makhana requires a temperature range of 20-35°C, relative humidity
of 50-90%, and annual rainfall between 100-250 cm.
Significance of Makhana Board
- Although Bihar accounts for 90% of the country’s makhana production, the largest exporters of makhana in
India are Punjab and Assam, with Punjab not even producing the crop itself.
- This is due to Bihar’s lack of a developed food processing industry and inadequate export infrastructure.
- Notably, none of Bihar’s airports have cargo facilities, which further limits export capabilities. Additionally,
low productivity in makhana cultivation is a significant issue. Currently, the cultivation process is extremely labor-intensive and challenging, driving up overall input costs.
- Further, farmers have been slow to adopt high-yield varieties of fox nut seeds developed by agricultural
institutes, such as Swarna Vaidehi and Sabour Makhana-1.
- The Makahana Board, with a budget of Rs 100 crore, is expected to provide training to farmers, making
them export oriented. People engaged in makhana cultivation will be organised in Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs).
- It will help to create an ecosystem that brings investments in the food processing sector and help create the
required export infrastructure.
Project Waterworth
- Meta introduced a project for internet subsea cable - Project Waterworth.
- Projects like Waterworth are the backbone of global digital infrastructure accounting for over 95% of
international traffic across the world’s oceans to support digital experiences.
- The project is using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to enhance subsea cable infrastructure to improve global
connectivity. It will utilize advanced machine learning models, to predict and mitigate potential disruptions, enhancing the resilience of subsea networks.
- It will strengthen the scale and reliability of the world’s digital highways by opening three new oceanic
corridors with high-speed connectivity needed to accelerate AI innovation across the world.
- It will cross 50,000 km in length to connect five continents and will bring enhanced connectivity to the U.S.,
India, Brazil, South Africa, and other locations, while becoming the longest subsea cable project in the world.

## Page 85

- The terminal is connected to a Multi-modal Logistic Parks (MMLP) at Jogighopa and a railway link is also
proposed to be established connecting Jogighopa terminal with MMLP.
- Built at a cost of Rs 82 crore, the terminal will play a major role in logistics and connectivity of Eastern India
and boost trilateral trade between India, Bhutan and Bangladesh.
- The terminal is at a distance of 108 km from Bangladesh border and 147 km from Guwahati. Also, it is just 91
km from Gelephu Bhutan (Gelephu Mindfulness City) where a modern city is under development.
- It is an important port of call for trade with Bangladesh given the MoU signed between India & Bangladesh
for developing economic corridor under Bharatmala Programme with Dalu-Tura-Goalpara-Gelephu multimodal trade route.
- It is one of the declared ports of call under Protocol on Inland Water Transit and Trade (PIWTT) between
India and Bangladesh.
Growth in Inland Waterways (IW)
- The IW sector has experienced an unprecedented rise in terms of trade and transport in the past decade.
- There has been a 767% increase in number of operational national waterways, a significant rise of 62% in
multi-modal terminals with 860% increase in budget allocation for IW.
- Further, cargo traffic on national waterways has witnessed an exponential growth – from 18 million tonnes
a decade ago to 133 million tonnes in FY 2023-24 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 22%.
Inland Waterways Development Council
- It was established in October 2023. Its objective is comprehensive development of inland waterways and the
associated Inland Water Transport (IWT) ecosystem for improved cargo efficiency, passenger movement, and river cruise tourism.
Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI)
- The IWAI is an autonomous body constituted in 1986, under the Inland Waterways Authority of India Act,
1. 
- It is primarily responsible for regulation, development & maintenance of National Waterways.

- Facilitating availability of long-term and short-term credit.
Details
- PMDKY will cover 100 districts based on three broad parameters: low productivity, moderate crop
intensity, and below-average credit parameters.
- Cropping intensity is a measure of how efficiently land is used.
- In simple terms, cropping intensity indicates the number of crops grown on a piece of land in an agricultural
year (July-June).
VAJIRAM AND RAVI The Recitals (February 2025) Page 84

---
## Page 86

- At all India level, the cropping intensity was recorded at 155% in 2021-22, although the figure greatly varied
from state to state. Cropping intensity was only 111% in 1950-51.
- Although the Budget does not provide a separate allocation for the scheme, funds will be drawn from
various schemes implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare, and the Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying.
Bharat Tex 2025
- Bharat Tex 2025, India's largest global textile event, was recently held at Bharat Mandapam, New Delhi.
- The event facilitates collaboration among manufacturers, exporters, and importers, providing them with an
opportunity to showcase their expertise, cutting-edge innovations, and latest collections to a global audience.
- It also serves as a platform to accelerate the government's "Farm to Fibre, Fabric, Fashion, and Foreign
Markets" vision.
India's Textile Industry
- India is the sixth-largest exporter of
textiles globally, contributing 8.21% to the country's total exports in 2023-24.
- The sector holds a 4.5% share in global
trade, with the United States and European Union accounting for 47% of India's textile and apparel exports.
- It provides direct employment to over
45 million people and supports the livelihoods of over 100 million individuals indirectly, including a large proportion of women and rural workers.
- It aligns with key government initiatives such as Make in India, Skill India, Women Empowerment, and Rural
Youth Employment, reinforcing its role in inclusive economic development.
Liquidity Injection Measures RBI has announced measures to inject liquidity into money markets, marking the largest monetary easing since the pandemic. These steps aim to address the liquidity shortfall caused by the central bank's intervention in selling dollars to stabilise the rupee.
Liquidity Problem
- The Indian banking system encountered its worst liquidity crunch in more than a decade in January 2025.
The liquidity deficit peaked at Rs 3.15 lakh crore its lowest level in nearly 15 years.
- Tax outflows, GST payments and the RBI’s forex interventions to stabilize the rupee and currency in
circulation (CIC) outflows significantly impacted cash flows in the banking system.
- The deficit led to increased dependence by banks on market borrowing, thereby keeping interbank call
money rates — rate at which banks lend to each other — consistently above the policy repo rate of 6.50 per cent.

RBI Reviews Economic Capital Framework RBI Governor said the central bank is currently reviewing the Economic Capital Framework (ECF).
RBI’s Current Review of the ECF
- RBI Governor’s Statement on ECF Review
o Recently, RBI Governor confirmed that the central bank is reviewing the ECF.
o This periodic review, recommended by the Bimal Jalan Committee, is meant to assess whether any adjustments are needed in the CRB range.
o RBI Governor clarified that while the current CRB stands at 6.5% (as of March 31, 2024), the review could lead to an increase or decrease in the required buffer, though no immediate changes have been confirmed.
- Background on the Bimal Jalan Committee
Recommendations o The Bimal Jalan-led panel had suggested a five-year review cycle for the ECF, with its recommendations valid from June 2019 to June 2024.
o Given this timeline, the RBI has now begun an internal assessment to evaluate whether changes are necessary.
Impact of the ECF Review on RBI’s Surplus Transfers
- Record Surplus Transfer to the Government in 2023-24
o For the financial year 2023-24, the RBI approved a record surplus transfer of ₹2.11 lakh crore to the central government.
o This amount significantly boosts government revenue and helps finance fiscal policies, including infrastructure projects and social welfare programs.
VAJIRAM AND RAVI The Recitals (February 2025) Page 86

---
## Page 88

- How CRB Adjustments Could Affect Future Dividends?
o Economists believe that any revision in the CRB threshold could directly impact future surplus transfers.
o If the CRB requirement is increased, the RBI may need to set aside more reserves, reducing the amount of surplus available for government transfers.
o Conversely, if the CRB is lowered, it could free up more funds for dividend payments.
- However, as per the officials, the decision to revise the CRB is not linked to current global uncertainties, and
any change will be based purely on economic factors rather than short-term concerns.
Importance of ECF Review
- Ensuring Economic Stability
o The CRB serves as an essential financial safeguard against global financial instability, banking crises, and currency fluctuations.
- Impact on Government Budget Planning
o The RBI’s surplus transfers play a crucial role in supporting government spending and fiscal deficit management. Any change in the ECF could influence the government’s budgetary planning for the upcoming fiscal years.
- Balancing Risk and Development Needs
o The RBI must strike a balance between maintaining financial stability and providing surplus funds to the government.

## INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS
Economic Impact of the Trump Trade War
- On February 1, President Trump signed an order imposing tariffs of 10% on all imports from China and 25%
on imports from Canada and Mexico.
- The move aims to curb illegal immigration and fentanyl exports but has triggered swift retaliation.
- Later, Trump delayed the imposition of 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada just hours before they were set to
take effect.
- However, tensions with China escalated as Beijing retaliated against US tariffs by investigating Google for
antitrust violations and imposing new tariffs on US coal, LNG, oil, and agricultural equipment.
- Trump also hinted at upcoming tariffs on the EU, citing trade imbalances.
Possible Impact of Tariffs Imposed by President Trump
- Economic Risks and Inflation Concerns
 Economists warn that the tariffs could worsen inflation, leading to higher prices for groceries, autos, and housing, potentially undermining Trump’s promise to lower costs.
- Escalation of Protectionist Policies
 Trump signaled plans for additional tariffs on computer chips, steel, oil, gas, pharmaceuticals, and European imports.
 This could lead to broader economic conflicts between the U.S. and major global economies.
- Impact on Jobs
 Despite claims of protecting US jobs, Trump’s tariffs had no substantial positive effect on employment in protected industries like steel.
 Automation and higher input costs might hurt other sectors.
 While some support tariffs for national security, most economists argue they fail to boost employment or reduce the trade deficit.
Fentanyl
- Fentanyl is a potent synthetic opioid approved for pain relief and anesthesia. It is about 100 times stronger
than morphine and 50 times stronger than heroin.
- Opioids are drugs that originate from or mimic substances found in the opium poppy plant.
- They provide pain relief and can cause euphoria but are highly addictive.
- Apart from fentanyl, other well-known opioids include oxycodone, morphine, codeine, and heroin.
- Overdosing on fentanyl can lead to severe health issues, including stupor, changes in pupil size, clammy
skin, cyanosis (blue skin), coma, and respiratory failure, which can be fatal.
National and International Legal Frameworks
- India: Fentanyl is regulated under the NDPS Act. Strict licenses are required for production, distribution,
and possession.
- UN Conventions: Listed under the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961, and the Convention on
Psychotropic Substances, 1971.
- US Efforts: The SUPPORT Act empowers federal agencies to combat fentanyl trafficking.

Trump Imposes 25% Tariff on Steel Imports
- Trump announced a 25% tariff on all foreign steel and aluminium imports, including from allies like Canada
and Mexico. He also plans to introduce reciprocal tariffs at later stage.
- This move follows previous tariff hikes on Chinese goods and threats against Europe, Taiwan, and key
industries.
India’s Concerns Amid Trump’s Fresh Tariff Threat
- Rising Steel Imports and Dumping Concerns
 There are concerns over dumping with steel imports already on the rise.
 Higher tariffs may divert Asian steel exports to India, intensifying competition and pushing domestic prices downward.
✓ In 2018, when the U.S. last imposed such tariffs, countries exporting steel to the U.S. were forced to seek alternative markets, flooding India with excess supply.
✓ This led to price drops and significant losses for domestic producers.
 Small Indian producers could suffer from low-cost Chinese dumping, requiring India to tread cautiously in its trade policies.
- Indian Steel Producers to Face Export Challenges
 Moody’s Ratings warned that Indian steelmakers will struggle to export following the US decision to impose an additional 25% tariff on steel and aluminium imports.
- Global Overcapacity Threatens Indian Manufacturing
 Countries like China, Japan, and South Korea face significant overcapacity in steel production.
 China, in particular, has shifted from long to flat products, increasing exports worldwide, which poses a risk to India’s domestic steel sector.
- Ripple Effects on Indian Steel Exports
 Past US tariffs led to trade diversions, with Chinese steel exports shifting towards Europe, prompting the EU to impose import restrictions that negatively impacted Indian exports.
 Experts warn that the new tariffs could once again disrupt the global stainless steel market.
- Rupee Under Pressure
 The Indian rupee is expected to weaken further due to market uncertainty and potential disruptions in trade.
- Canada & Brazil Face Direct Impact; India Less Affected
 The US imports most of its steel from Canada, Brazil, and Mexico, with South Korea and Vietnam also being significant suppliers.
✓ Canada alone accounted for 79% of US primary aluminum imports in the first 11 months of 2024.
 India’s primary steel exports to the US in 2024 amounted to $450 million, while aluminium exports reached $820 million.
✓ Steel pipes, tubes, and related products had minimal exports, totalling just $2.83 million, indicating limited direct impact from the new tariffs.
Trump Engages Putin in Talks for Negotiated Ukraine War Settlement
- President Trump, in his second term, held a "lengthy and highly productive" call with Russian President Putin,
marking their first confirmed conversation since Trump resumed office.
VAJIRAM AND RAVI The Recitals (February 2025) Page 90

## Page 92

- The discussion signaled the start of a US-backed effort to negotiate an end to the Ukraine war.
- On the other hand, the European officials have asserted that Ukraine and Europe must be part of any
negotiations, responding to Trump’s announcement of US-Russia peace talks.
Trump’s Stance on NATO and Ukraine’s Borders  Trump has signaled a shift in US policy, suggesting that Ukraine should abandon its NATO bid and that restoring its pre-2014 borders was unrealistic.
 As per various experts, the US is deprioritizing European security, emphasizing border control and deterring China instead.
Significance of Trump-Putin Call
- A Potential Shift in Global Relations
 Trump is reshaping great power dynamics, with his latest call to Putin marking a significant departure from past US policy.
 Trump announced immediate ceasefire talks for Ukraine and plans to meet Putin in Saudi Arabia soon.
- Europe’s Exclusion from Trump-Putin Talks
- Implications for Asia and India: The impact of a potential Trump-Putin deal on Asia remains unclear.
###  Key questions arise:
✓ Will Trump shift focus to counter China?
✓ Could he extend his peace efforts to Taiwan?
✓ How will this affect Moscow-Beijing ties?
 For India, this is a crucial moment. Unlike in the mid-20th century, India now holds significant influence in global affairs.
 With both nations facing trade deficits with China, PM Modi may align with Trump’s call for a new economic order led by democratic nations to ensure balanced trade.
Donald Trump Offers ‘Gold Card’ Visas For US Citizenship

Tea Horse Road Connecting India – China
- Recently, China’s Ambassador to India Xu Feihong posted on X (Twitter) about the historic Tea Horse Road
which spanned more than 2,000 km, and connected China to India via Tibet.
- The Tea Horse Road, played a key role in commerce and cultural exchange for centuries.
- While less famous than the Silk Road, this route facilitated the movement of tea, horses, and other valuable
commodities across some of the world's most challenging terrains.
Tea Horse Road
- The Tea Horse Road traces its origins to the Tang Dynasty (618-907 CE),
when trade between Southwest China, Tibet, and India first flourished.
- Buddhist monk Yijing (635-713 CE) documented early trade exchanges,
mentioning the movement of goods such as sugar, textiles, and rice noodles from China, while horses, Tibetan gold, saffron, and medicinal herbs were exported.
- By the 10th century, during the Song Dynasty (960-1279 CE), official
markets were established along the route to regulate the trade of tea and horses, which became the dominant commodities exchanged between China and Tibet.
- Expansion of Trade in the Early 20th Century
 With the fall of the Qing Dynasty in 1912, the Tea Horse Road became even more vital. Yunnan’s tea industry expanded as China integrated into the global market.
- World War II and the Road’s Strategic Importance
 During World War II, when Japan controlled much of China’s coastline, the Tea Horse Road served as an alternative supply route for transporting goods and military supplies to China’s resistance forces.
- Decline After the Founding of the People's Republic of China (1949)
 Following the establishment of the People’s Republic of China, the importance of the Tea Horse Road declined.
 Mao Zedong’s land reforms significantly changed trade patterns, and with the advancement of modern transportation, the historic trade route lost its relevance.
 However, some remnants remain, particularly in regions like Lijiang, which became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997 due to its historical significance in trade.

Mineral Resources of Ukraine
- US President Donald Trump accused Ukraine of reneging on an unofficial deal granting the US access to 50%
of its mineral resources in exchange for support against Russia.
- Ukraine views the deal as a way to secure future assistance, while Trump seeks compensation for past US aid.
- The details remain undisclosed, but Trump claims Ukraine owes the US $500 billion worth of resources,
including minerals, fuel, and infrastructure (such as ports), in return for military support against Russia.
 US officials argue that securing economic stakes in Ukraine—such as mining rights—would serve as a security guarantee.
 Zelenskyy, however, seeks a more concrete military and economic assurance rather than indirect security through economic involvement.
Importance of Ukraine’s Mineral Resources
- Ukraine possesses rich mineral resources
crucial for manufacturing high-end weapon systems, clean energy solutions (such as electric vehicles), electronic gadgets, and semiconductors.
- These minerals are rare and difficult to
extract, making them highly valuable.
Geopolitical Significance
- China has large reserves of these critical minerals, making Ukraine’s resources strategically important for the
US and the West.
 The US seeks rare-earth elements, titanium, gallium, and other critical minerals for weapons systems, clean energy, and reducing dependence on China.
- US President Donald Trump’s interest in acquiring Greenland is also partly driven by mineral resource
concerns.
Cook Islands, China Sign Comprehensive Strategic Partnership Deal

infrastructure, climate resilience, and disaster preparedness.
- New Zealand’s Concerns
 New Zealand, which has constitutional ties with the Cook Islands, expressed concern over the agreement, stating it had not been allowed to review the documents before they were signed.
- China’s Growing Influence in the Pacific
 New Zealand and its allies, including the U.S., have been wary of China’s expanding presence in the South Pacific, fearing that it could weaken Western influence in the region.

### • Ensuring Legal Pathways for Migration:
 Over 1 million visas were issued to Indian nationals in 2024, including record numbers of student and business visas.
 72% of H-1B visas issued in the last fiscal year went to Indian professionals.
- India is actively considering a new law
 The Indian government is actively considering a new law, tentatively titled the ‘Overseas Mobility (Facilitation and Welfare) Bill, 2024’, to regulate and facilitate safe, orderly, and legal migration for overseas employment.
✓ The bill aims to replace the outdated Emigration Act of 1983 to address modern global migration challenges.
✓ It seeks to facilitate circular mobility of Indian workers while ensuring their safety and welfare abroad.
✓ MEA is currently consulting with line ministries, after which the draft will be opened for public consultation before finalization.
- Other Efforts to Ensure Safe and Legal Migration
 Collaboration with Embassies & Consulates: The Protector of Emigrants, in coordination with Indian embassies, ensures the welfare and grievance redressal of Indian emigrants.
 Awareness & Advisory Initiatives: Indian missions issue advisories and awareness programs for prospective emigrants to educate them on safe migration practices, valid job opportunities, and registered recruiting agents.
 Addressing Grievances & Exploitation: Indian authorities actively handle complaints of mistreatment, wage fraud, and contract violations by foreign employers and recruitment agencies.
 Rescue & Repatriation Support: In cases of exploitation or distress, Indian embassies assist in the rescue, repatriation, and reintegration of affected emigrants while supporting their families in India.
Conclusion The India-US immigration issue is a test of diplomatic balance. While India cooperates on deportations, it remains focused on protecting the rights and opportunities of legal travellers, students, and skilled professionals.
With Trump's aggressive immigration policies, India continues to engage in strategic diplomacy, ensuring that bilateral ties remain strong while managing evolving immigration challenges.

About Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack
- DDoS attack is a cyberattack designed to disrupt the normal functioning of a server, service, or network by
overwhelming it with excessive internet traffic.
- How It Works
 Unlike a Denial of Service (DoS) attack, which originates from a single source, a DDoS attack uses multiple compromised systems, often infected with malware, to generate traffic.
 These systems form a botnet that floods the target with requests.
- Types of DDoS Attacks
 Bandwidth Saturation: Overloading a site’s bandwidth.
 Protocol Exploitation: Exploiting vulnerabilities in network protocols.
 Application Targeting: Attacking weaknesses in specific applications or services.
- Impact
 DDoS attacks can cripple online services, making them inaccessible to legitimate users and causing financial and reputational damage.
- Prominent DDoS Attacks
Attack on X Platform Attack on Microsoft- (August 2024) owned GitHub (2015) Romance Scams
- Experts and authorities have warned about rising romance scams involving emotional manipulation, deceit,
and financial fraud.
- According to a Moody’s report, India ranked third
globally in new romance scam profiles in 2024, accounting for 12% of the total, behind the US (38%) and Nigeria (14%).
Romance Scams
- Romance frauds typically occur through dating apps
and social media, where scammers create fake online profiles to lure victims.
- According to the Indian Cyber Crime Coordination
Centre (I4C), fraudsters gain trust and then demand money, gifts, bank details, or intimate content.
- These scams often pose a risk to victims’ personal safety, as criminals may belong to organized networks.
- Rise of Romance Scams During Covid-19
 The Covid-19 pandemic saw a sharp increase in such scams, as fraudsters exploited people’s isolation and emotional vulnerability.
 A technique called “love bombing”—where scammers excessively express affection to gain victims’ trust—was commonly used.
- Financial and Reputational Risks
 Moody’s warns that money from romance scams, including sextortion, is often laundered through banks, exposing financial institutions to reputational damage and legal penalties.

 Sextortion—which mainly targets teenage boys—involves extortion using fake profiles to solicit explicit content, later used to blackmail victims.
- Preventive Measures
 Authorities advise people to avoid sending money or sharing sensitive personal information with strangers online and to be cautious about the details they share on social media.
TRAI Tightens Rules Against Spam Calls & Text Messages
- India’s telecom regulator, TRAI, has introduced new rules under the Telecom Commercial Communications
Customer Preference Regulations (TCCCPR), 2018, to curb spam calls and messages.
- Telecom operators like Airtel, Jio, and Vi must analyze call and SMS patterns in real time to detect spammers
and report spam activity.
- Misreporting can result in fines ranging from ₹2 lakh for the first offense to ₹10 lakh for repeated violations.
- The revised regulations aim to combat evolving telecom misuse and create a more transparent commercial
communication system for consumers.
Cracking Down on Spam Communication
- Faster Action Against Spam
 Users can now report spam more easily, with telecom operators required to act within 5 days, down from the previous 30-day limit.
- Clear Identification of Spam Calls
 Telemarketers can no longer use normal 10-digit numbers for promotional calls. Instead: ✓ 140 series remains for promotional calls.
✓ 1600 series is now designated for transactional and service calls (already being implemented).
- Opting Out of Promotional Messages
 Telecom operators must provide a mechanism for users to opt out of promotional communication, though users can opt in anytime.
- Stricter Monitoring of Spam Activity
 Operators must analyze call and SMS patterns based on factors like: High call volumes Short call durations Low incoming-to-outgoing call ratios  This real-time monitoring helps detect potential spammers.
 Legitimate business messages will now have further disclosure requirements. “Customers will be able to identify the type of commercial message by just looking at its header as “-P”, “-S”, “-T”, and “-G” for identification of promotional, service, transactional, and government messages, respectively.
- Stronger Verification & Penalties
 Telemarketers must undergo physical verification, biometric authentication, and unique mobile number linking.
 Repeated violators will have all telecom resources suspended.
 Operators must maintain detailed records of complaints and sender information to ensure quick action.

### Biodiversity Heritage Site (BHS):
- These are notified by State Governments in India, in consultation with local communities, under Section 37
of the Biological Diversity Act, 2002.
- The criteria for designation include: Areas of significant biodiversity that may include High endemism
(species found nowhere else), Presence of rare, endangered, or threatened species, Unique or representative ecosystems, Wild ancestors of domesticated species, Areas with cultural, ethical, or aesthetic values related to biodiversity
- It is managed by Biodiversity Management Committees (BMCs) at the local level, with support from State
Biodiversity Boards (SBBs).
- Examples: Nallur Tamarind Grove in Karnataka, Majuli River Island in Assam (The world's largest river
island), Ameenpur Lake in Telangana, Khecheopalri Wetland in Sikkim Inland MANGROVES
- Inland mangroves, distinct from their coastal counterparts, are unique ecosystems found away from coastal
shorelines, typically along riverbanks, estuaries, and inland water bodies.
- Unlike their coastal counterparts, these mangroves thrive in non-tidal conditions, often relying on
groundwater sources for sustenance.
- These are rare and have been reported from only eight locations across the globe till date. The Guneri
inland mangrove site is the last remains of its kind in India.
About Guneri mangrove site
- Guneri mangrove site is located at a distance of 45 km from the Arabian Sea and four km from the Kori
Creek, where seawater never approaches. It is also devoid of any sludge and is spread over a flat piece of land like a forest.
- Origin: It might have originated either after the marine transgression which occurred in the area during the
Miocene period or on the bank of the lost river (the Saraswati River) in the Great Rann of Kachchh. The Saraswati, a mythological river, is assumed to have once run in Great Rann of Kachchh during 3000-4000

## Page 112

About Marine Heat waves (MHW)
- It occurs when the surface temperature of a particular region of the sea rises to 3- 4 degrees Celsius above
the average temperature for at least five days.
- MHWs have increased by 50% over the past decade and now last longer and are more severe (report by the
## IUCN 2021)
- Causes: changes in ocean currents, atmospheric conditions (e.g., high-pressure systems, reduced wind), and
increased greenhouse gas concentrations leading to ocean warming.
✓ Atmospheric Patterns: Phenomena such as El Niño and La Niña influence ocean temperatures, with El Niño often leading to warmer sea surfaces.
- Impacts: Coral bleaching (Great Barrier Reef), Seagrass die-off, Marine biodiversity loss (shifts in species
distributions), Harmful algal blooms, ✓ Climate Feedback: Warmer oceans can alter weather patterns, contributing to extreme events like hurricanes and altering precipitation distribution.
- Examples: The “Blob,” a massive MHW in the North Pacific (2013-2016), had devastating impacts on marine
life, including mass die-offs of seabirds and marine mammals. The 2011 MHW off the coast of Western Australia caused significant losses in the abalone and rock lobster fisheries.
✓ Indian Ocean: Studies indicate that by 2050, the Indian Ocean could experience MHWs for 220-250 days annually, potentially leading to intensified cyclones and threats to fisheries.
Potash Reserves The Punjab government will explore potash mining in Fazilka and Sri Muktsar Sahib districts, where surveys previously detected large mineral reserves.
- Surveys of the Geological Survey of India (GSI) have also identified reserves in parts of Rajasthan
(northwestern Nagaur-Ganganagar basin, including the Ganganagar and Hanumangarh districts that border Fazilka and Muktsar) ✓ These findings position Punjab as the second Indian state, after Rajasthan, to have significant potash reserves.
✓ Potash is mined from underground deposits formed by the evaporation of ancient seas. These deposits are found in various parts of the world, with Canada (leads with over 33% of these reserves), Belarus & Russia being major producers.
- India lacks domestic potash production. This exploration will reduce India’s dependence on imports and
bolstering the domestic fertilizer industry. India imports 50 lakh tonnes of potash annually, primarily used in fertilisers and industries.
- According to the National Mineral Inventory (NMI) database, the total potash resources are estimated at
23,091 million tonnes in 2020. Rajasthan alone contributes 89% to the total resources.
About Potash
- Primarily refers to potassium compounds, most commonly potassium chloride (KCl), Other forms include
potassium sulfate (K2SO4) and potassium carbonate (K2CO3).
- Over 90% of potash is used as fertilizer and it is one of the three primary agricultural nutrients (Nitrogen,
Phosphorus and Potassium or N-P-K).
- Forms of Potash fertilizers: Sulphate of Potash (SOP), a premium potash fertilizer that is free of chloride (a
compound considered harmful to plants). On the other hand, Muriate of Potash (MOP- most commonly used potash fertilizer) contains some chloride.
VAJIRAM AND RAVI The Recitals (February 2025) Page 111

## Page 115

- Geological Formation: It is composed of deformed rock layers that have been folded due to intense
geological stress over hundreds of millions of years. It’s a product of ancient orogenic events (mountain- building processes). It involves both the Aravalli and Delhi Supergroups of rocks.
✓ The Khetri Copper Belt (Rajasthan) is a major copper mining region due to mineralization linked to ancient geological processes.
- Tectonic History: Long and complex tectonic history, with multiple phases of rifting, sedimentation, and
orogenic events.
✓ Experienced multiple phases of sedimentation, folding, and faulting due to collision of cratons (Bundelkhand Craton & Marwar Craton).
- Seismic Activity: While the region is relatively stable compared to the Himalayan region, it still experiences
occasional mild earthquakes. These earthquakes are generally attributed to the release of localized stress within ancient faults.
- India’s seismic zoning map divides the country into four zones (Zone 2, 3, 4, and 5) based on earthquake
risk.
- Delhi falls in Seismic Zone 4. Presence of Mahendragarh-Dehradun Fault, Delhi-Haridwar Ridge, Sohna Fault
makes it vulnerable to mild earthquakes.
Zone 5: Highest seismic activity Himalayan region Zone 4: High risk Delhi, Jammu & Kashmir, Bihar Zone 3: Moderate risk Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata Zone 2: Low risk Deccan Plateau TrailGuard AI System To Detect Poachers TrailGuard AI is being used in reserves, including Kanha Tiger Reserve, Dudhwa National Park and Similipal Tiger Reserve using 100-150 AI-enabled cameras to detect poachers.

Compensatory Afforestation Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) has flagged that the funds allocated for compensatory afforestation were diverted for other activities by Uttarakhand’s Forest divisions.
- The report flagged that in 37 cases, compensatory afforestation was executed after more than eight years
of getting final clearance. As per CAMPA guidelines, after receiving funds, afforestation should be conducted within a year, or two growing seasons.
VAJIRAM AND RAVI The Recitals (February 2025) Page 114

## Page 116

Compensatory Afforestation (to maintain ecological balance and biodiversity)
- It aims to compensate for the deforestation caused by development projects like infrastructure, mining,
and industrial expansion.
- When forest land is diverted, the user agency (the entity undertaking the project) is required to plant trees
in an equivalent or greater area of non-forest or degraded forest land. This involves funding the afforestation activities, including planting, maintenance, and monitoring.
- Case study: Odisha has seen extensive forest land diversion for mining projects, particularly for minerals
like iron ore and bauxite. CAMPA funds were allocated to Odisha to undertake compensatory afforestation and related activities. It emphasizes the need for greater community participation, transparency, and accountability in CAMPA implementation.
✓ In Madhya Pradesh, resistance by Baiga and Gond tribes led to the revision of compensatory afforestation plans to ensure their participation and benefit-sharing.
Legal Framework
- The Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, is the primary legislation governing compensatory afforestation.
✓ In June 2022, the government amended the Forest Conservation Rules to propose a mechanism to allow developers to raise plantations "over land on which the (FC) Act is not applicable" and to swap such plots against subsequent requirements of compensatory afforestation.
- The Compensatory Afforestation Fund Act, 2016, and its associated rules, establish the framework for
managing the funds collected for compensatory afforestation.
- The Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA) oversees the
implementation of compensatory afforestation activities.
✓ National CAMPA Advisory Council has been established as per orders of Supreme Court.
- The states deposit money collected from user agencies with the national CAF (Compensatory Afforestation
Fund) to be eventually credited into state CAFs as per their entitlement. The states, however, receive only 90% of their share; the other 10% are held back to cover administrative expenses.
- National Green Tribunal (NGT) Orders: Stricter compliance on compensatory afforestation projects.
Reclassification of Major Minerals The Ministry of Mines reclassified Barytes, Feldspar, Mica, and Quartz as major minerals from their previous minor mineral status.
The distinction between Major Minerals and Minor Minerals in India It is based on their economic significance, regulatory framework, and industrial use. This classification is defined under the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 (MMDR Act).
Major Minerals Minor Minerals Minerals that are of high economic importance Minerals that are less valuable and are primarily used in and are used extensively in industrial and construction, local industries, and minor commercial infrastructure development. purposes.
Rationale of Reclassification
- In consonance with government’s focus on enhancing the domestic mining of critical minerals with India’s
focus on self-reliance in critical minerals.
- These minerals are often associated with other valuable critical minerals like Lithium, Beryl, and
Tantalum.
VAJIRAM AND RAVI The Recitals (February 2025) Page 115

## Page 117

- Need for Domestic Mining of Critical Minerals: India relies heavily on imports for critical minerals.
Reclassification helps in better exploration, reporting, and extraction of associated minerals.
✓ Example: Lithium (imported from China & Australia) → Essential for EV batteries.
- Previously, under minor mineral leases, the focus was primarily on their use in construction and ceramics,
leading to the under-extraction and under-reporting of associated critical minerals.
✓ Example: Mica was largely mined for paints and insulation but has aerospace applications too.
- Global Energy Transition & India's Green Energy Push: India’s 2070 Net-Zero target and expansion of
solar PV & wind energy need these minerals.
✓ Barytes in radiation shielding → Useful in nuclear power plants & space technology.
Key Minerals & Their Strategic Importance Mineral Previous Use Strategic Relevance After Reclassification Barytes Used in oil drilling Nuclear shielding, medical industry, space tech Feldspar Essential for ceramics, glass, and paints. Battery-grade materials, advanced glass coatings Mica Electrical insulation, cosmetics. Defense, aerospace, satellites Quartz Industrial applications. Semiconductors, solar PV, fiber optics Major Minerals
- Those specified in the First Schedule of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957
(MMDR Act).
- Including: Metallic minerals (e.g., iron ore, manganese, copper, gold); Non-metallic minerals (e.g.,
limestone, mica, barytes, quartz, feldspar); Fossil Fuels (Energy Minerals; Coal, Lignite, Uranium)
- Regulation and development: It involve both the central and state governments, with the central
government (Oversees mining through The Indian Bureau of Mines (IBM)) playing a significant role in policy formulation and national-level oversight.
✓ National Mineral Exploration Policy, 2016 and "National Mineral Policy, 2019" formulates policies aimed at promoting sustainable mining practices
- Lease Period: Up to 50 years, as per Section 8A of the MMDR Act, 1957.
Black Plastic Recent study about Black Plastic observed that it contains toxic flame retardants, raising concerns over food contamination and health risks.
About Black Plastic (made from polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), and polyethylene (PE))
- It refers to plastics dyed with carbon black pigments, commonly used in packaging, electronics, automotive
parts, and household goods.
- It often contains recycled materials, sometimes including electronic waste. This can introduce potentially
harmful substances like flame retardants and heavy metals.
- Recyclability Issues: Optical sorting technology often fails to detect the black pigment, leading to these
items being rejected and sent to landfills.

## GARBHINI-DRISHTI
India made a major leap forward with the opening of its first Ferret Research Facility, the launch of the GARBH- INi-DRISHTI data repository.
About GARBH-INi-DRISHTI (initiative of Department of Biotechnology (DBT)
- It is a data repository and information sharing hub established at the Translational Health Science and
Technology Institute (THSTI) in Faridabad, Haryana
- Primary goal: to advance research and improve healthcare interventions related to maternal and neonatal
health.
- It provides access to a wealth of clinical data, images, and biospecimens collected from over 12,000
pregnant women, newborns, and postpartum mothers. This makes it one of South Asia’s largest maternal and child health databases.
- GARBHINI-DRISHTI is an integral part of the larger GARBH-INi program, which is a collaborative
interdisciplinary program initiated by the DBT in 2014. GARBH-INi focuses on understanding and addressing the biological and non-biological risks associated with preterm birth.
✓ Preterm birth is a leading cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity.
✓ The GARBH-INi program has made notable strides in this area, including the identification of 19 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs or genetic markers) associated with spontaneous preterm births among Indian women.
✓ Such genetic insights are crucial for developing predictive tools and targeted interventions.
SRY Gene Recent studies revealed that certain rare cases where biological females carried the SRY gene, are challenging conventional understanding of sex determination.
About SRY Gene (Sex-determining Region Y)
- It is a crucial gene located on the Y chromosome that plays a primary role for initiating male sex
determination in mammals, including humans. Its presence typically leads to the development of male characteristics.
✓ The Y chromosome is indeed small, containing roughly 50 to 60 genes and representing about 2% of a cell's total DNA, primarily involved in male sex determination and development.
- It codes for a protein called Testis-Determining Factor (TDF), also sometimes referred to as the SRY protein.
This protein acts as a master switch, triggering the development of the undifferentiated gonad into a testis in a developing embryo.
- The TDF protein acts as a transcription factor, meaning it binds to DNA and regulates the expression of other
genes involved in testis development. It initiates a cascade of events that lead to the formation of the Sertoli cells, which are crucial for further male reproductive development.
Clinical Implications
- Mutations or alterations in the SRY gene can lead to disorders of sex development (DSDs).
✓ For instance, Swyer syndrome is a condition where individuals with an XY karyotype develop female characteristics due to mutations in the SRY gene.
VAJIRAM AND RAVI The Recitals (February 2025) Page 120

## Page 122

- Conversely, the presence of the SRY gene in individuals with an XX karyotype can result in testicular
development and male characteristics.
- Routine Role of Chromosomes in Sex Determination
✓ Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes. The first 22 pairs, called autosomes, are identical in males and females. The 23rd pair, the sex chromosomes, determines sex: XX (female) or XY (male).
✓ Egg cells always carry an X chromosome, while sperm cells carry either X or Y.
✓ If a sperm with an X chromosome fertilizes an egg, the baby is female (XX); if a Y-carrying sperm fertilizes the egg, the baby is male (XY).
Einstein Ring The European Space Agency’s (ESA) Euclid space telescope has discovered a rare ring of light, known as an Einstein ring, around a galaxy (NGC 6505) nearly 590 million light-years away from Earth.
✓ This discovery is notable for its clarity and proximity, providing a unique opportunity to study the mass distribution within NGC 6505, including its dark matter content.
About Einstein Ring
- It is a phenomenon of gravitational lensing where the light from a distant source (like a galaxy or quasar) is
bent and magnified by a massive object (like another galaxy or black hole) lying between the source and the observer.
✓ Gravitational Lensing (as predicted by Albert Einstein's General Theory of Relativity): Massive objects warp spacetime, causing light passing nearby to bend. This bending is analogous to how a lens bends light.
- This bending of light can cause the image of the source to be distorted into a ring-like shape around the
lensing object Provides Information About
- Mass Distribution: The shape and size of the Einstein ring can be used to calculate the mass of the lensing
object, including dark matter, which doesn’t emit light.
- Distant Objects: They can magnify the light from very distant and faint objects, allowing us to study them
in greater detail (to study the expansion of the universe).
Examples of Einstein Ring
- Einstein’s Cross: While not a complete ring, this is a example of gravitational lensing where a quasar’s light
is distorted into four distinct images surrounding a lensing galaxy.
- B1938+666: Nearly complete Einstein ring (discovered in 1998, using the Hubble Space Telescope), where
the light from a distant galaxy is lensed into a ring by a foreground galaxy.

Indirect Prompt Injection Researchers have warned about rapidly growing Indirect prompt injection attacks on AI chat bots particularly those that use Large Language Models (LLMs).
About Indirect Prompt Injection Attacks
- Manipulating the Context: Unlike direct prompt injection where an attacker directly interacts with the LLM,
indirect attacks manipulate the data sources that the LLM relies on for context.
- Hiding Instructions: Attackers embed malicious instructions within seemingly harmless data, like emails,
documents, or even online content.
✓ The hidden instructions blend into benign-looking content, evading traditional detection mechanisms.
✓ Website Attack: Hidden text on a webpage manipulates search engine chatbots to generate biased responses or incorrect data.
- The LLM is Tricked: When the LLM processes this data, it unknowingly executes the hidden instructions,
potentially leading to harmful actions.
Threats Posed by It
- Exploit the vast range of data sources that LLMs access, making them harder to defend against.
- The malicious instructions can be hidden in plain sight, making them difficult to detect.
o Diverse Attack Vectors: These attacks can be used for various malicious purposes: o Data Exfiltration: Stealing sensitive information.
o Denial of Service: Disrupting the LLM’s functionality.
o Disinformation: Spreading false or misleading information.
o Malicious Code Execution: Triggering harmful actions within the system.
Mitigation techniques include: Data Sanitization, Access Control, Input Validation, Security Monitoring and User Awareness ** US National Cybersecurity Strategy (2023) highlights AI security as a national priority.
** EU AI Act (2023) emphasizes safety, transparency, and accountability in AI deployment.

- India joined the ITER project in 2005
- India has contributed critical components such as the Cryostat (designed to encase and thermally insulate
the reactor), the world's largest high-vacuum pressure chamber, manufactured by Larsen & Toubro (L&T).
Purpose
- To produce 500 megawatts of fusion power from 50 megawatts of input heating power, achieving a tenfold
energy gain.
- It is designed to produce a “burning plasma,” (over 150 million°C, hotter than the Sun) where the fusion
reactions (Future energy Source) themselves provide the majority of the heating.
✓ The fusion reaction involves the combining of deuterium and tritium atoms, releasing vast amounts of energy.
- Fusion vs. Fission: Unlike conventional nuclear power plants (which use fission), fusion reactors:
✓ Have no risk of meltdowns (e.g., Chernobyl, Fukushima disasters).
✓ Produce less radioactive waste than Fission Reaction.
Technology behind Fusion Process
- Uses a “tokamak” design (nuclear fusion reactors ), a doughnut-shaped device (a toroidal) that uses
powerful magnets to confine and control super-heated plasma.
- China’s EAST (Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak) reactor has achieved 120 million°C for
over 100 seconds.
✓ They are often also called ‘artificial suns’ due to the fact that these doughnut-shaped machines replicate processes that occur in the sun. Currently over 200 tokamaks in operation across the globe Coronal Holes A new study has estimated the physical parameters of thermal and magnetic field structures of solar coronal holes.
About Coronal Holes (first discovered in the 1970s by X-ray satellites)

## Page 125

- They are cooler, less dense areas compared to the surrounding plasma characterized by open, unipolar
magnetic field lines. These open magnetic field lines allow solar wind to escape more readily into space, resulting in high-speed solar wind streams
- Coronal holes contribute to intense auroras due to increased geomagnetic activity in polar regions.
Example: The Northern Lights (Aurora Borealis) are more vibrant during periods of high solar wind activity.
✓ Energetic particles from coronal holes can affect stratospheric ozone concentration, influencing global temperature patterns.
- They are more common and persistent during solar minimum periods and can vary in size and duration,
lasting from a few weeks to months.
✓ NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and ESA’s Solar Orbiter actively monitor coronal holes to predict space weather impacts.
✓ India’s Aditya-L1 Mission (launched in 2023) is dedicated to studying solar activity and space weather.
Significance
- Coronal holes are a source of high-speed solar wind, which can interact with Earth’s magnetosphere,
causing geomagnetic storms.
- These can affect satellites (increase drag on low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites), communication systems (affect
GPS accuracy), and even power grids.
✓ HF radio signals are disrupted due to ionospheric disturbances caused by solar storms. Pilots flying over polar regions experience radio blackouts due to solar activity.
- They have also been shown to have influence on weather patterns, such as the Indian summer
monsoon. High-speed solar wind alters Earth’s upper atmospheric circulation, influencing cloud formation and precipitation patterns.

Pagri Sambhal Jatta Movement Farmers protesting at the Punjab and Haryana borders, observed February 23 as Pagri Sambhal Diwas, in honour of Ajit Singh, paternal uncle of freedom fighter Bhagat Singh.
Ajit Singh
- Born in February, 1881, in Khatkar Kalan, Punjab, Ajit Singh was a key freedom fighter and revolutionary who
inspired his nephew Bhagat Singh.
VAJIRAM AND RAVI The Recitals (February 2025) Page 127

## Page 129

- Exiled from 1909 to 1947 for his involvement in the Pagri Sambhal Jatta movement, he returned to India in
1947 but passed away in Dalhousie on August 15, 1947 due to ill health.
Pagri Sambhal Jatta (PSJ) Movement
- ‘Pagri Sambhal Jatta’ literally translates to ‘take care of your turban, o farmer’, and invokes self respect and
honour.
- The slogan PSJ was given by Banke Dayal, a nationalist poet, and became a symbol of resistance.
- In 1907, Ajit Singh started the PSJ movement in protest against three agricultural laws imposed by the
British.
- The three laws were: The Punjab Land Alienation Act, 1900; The Punjab Land Colonisation Act, 1906; and
The Doab Bari Act, 1907.
- The Punjab Land Alienation Act restricted the rights of farmers to sell or mortgage their land freely. It
favoured moneylenders and landlords, making it difficult for peasants to escape debt.
- The Punjab Land Colonisation Act gave the British control over land ownership in the newly developed
Chenab Colony (now in Pakistan).
- Farmers had to transfer their land to the British government upon death instead of passing it to their heirs.
- The Doab Bari Act, 1907, too, took away farmers’ ownership rights over their lands, effectively reducing
them to contract workers.
- Along with this, the British raised taxes on agricultural land and water for irrigation, increasing the financial
burden on farmers. Many small farmers and peasants were forced into debt and land loss.
- Soon, farmers started protests against these laws, demanding their repeal. Ajit Singh and Kishan Singh
(Bhagat Singh’s father) formed the Bharat Mata Society, a revolutionary group for farmers. Lala Lajpat Rai and other leaders also supported the movement.
Impact of the Movement
- The movement was one of the first major farmer uprisings against British rule in Punjab, leading to mass
protests and civil disobedience. Under pressure, the British withdrew some oppressive laws. It inspired future protests like the Ghadar Movement and Bhagat Singh’s activities.
- Ajit Singh and Lala Lajpat Rai were arrested in May 1907 and exiled to Burma, but released in November. Ajit
Singh later traveled across Europe, working with revolutionaries.
Ali Ai Ligang Festival
- Assam’s largest tribal community, the Mising tribe celebrated the Ali Ai Ligang festival in Jorhat.
- Started around 40 years, ago, the festival is observed every year on the first Wednesday of the month of
Fagun.
- The meaning of Ali is seed and roots, Ai stands for fruits and Ligang means to sow. Thus, Ali Ai Ligang is the
first sowing of fruits and roots.
- Deeply rooted in agricultural traditions, the festival marks the beginning of the sowing season and is
celebrated as a festival of cultivation.
- The festival begins with Laitom Tomchar (flag hoisting). Prayers are offered to God, Donyi Polo (mother Sun
and Father Moon), seeking protection for crops from insects and natural calamities.
- At Morung Okum (Morung Ghar - a dormitory for youth), where Apong (traditional wine), meat, fish and
other traditional foods are offered to the God. After which the traditional Gumrag dance is performed by men and women.

Lezim
- A Hindi film Chhava, based on the life of Maratha ruler Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj has
led to a controversy with people objecting to a Lezim dance sequence.
- Lezim is a folk-dance form of Maharashtra. Lezim is a small mallet, made of a thin wood
with pieces of metal (like cymbals) strung together, which produce a sound after swinging. The dance form is named after this instrument.
- Lezim is as much a rigorous physical exercise, a drill, as a dance. The formations are in
twos and fours and sometimes even a circle.
- Vigorous movements, such as stepping, squatting, and jumping, form an intrinsic part of the dance.
- The dance is accompanied by a dhol or dhalgi (small dhol). There are no wind or string instruments
accompanying it.
- There are three main types of Lezim - military lezim (mostly used as a martial art for defense), talathekya
and samanyajananna.
Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj
- Sambhaji Maharaj, son of Chhatrapati Shivaji, ruled the Maratha kingdom from 1681 to 1689 after a violent
succession battle with his half-brother Rajaram.
- His reign was marked by frequent clashes with Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, who aimed to expand into the
Deccan.
- While Sambhaji was able to defend many famous forts against Mughal forces for some years, he was
captured by them in 1689 and eventually put to death.
International Mother Language Day
- International Mother Language Day (IMLD) 2025 was
recently celebrated across the globe on February 21. It has been observed every year since the year 2000 to promote linguistic and cultural diversity and multilingualism.
- This year marks the 25th anniversary of IMLD, with the
theme “Silver Jubilee Celebration of International Mother Language Day”.
Background
- The Day was proclaimed by UNESCO in 1999. Later, the UN
General Assembly recognized it in a resolution in 2002.
- UNESCO declared the Day, to commemorate a 1952 protest against West Pakistan’s imposition of Urdu as
the official language of East Pakistan (present-day Bangladesh).
- In Bangladesh, since 1953, February 21 is observed as Ekushe Day, after the Bengali word for twenty-one.
Status of Languages across the World
- Globally, English remains the most widely spoken language with ~1.5 billion speakers, followed by Mandarin
with ~1.11 billion. Hindi is third with ~609.5 million speakers, while Bengali is seventh with ~273 million.

Libia Lobo Sardesai
- Goan freedom fighter Libia Lobo Sardesai, aged 100, has been honoured with the Padma Shri for her role in
the state’s liberation struggle.
- Born in 1924 in Portuguese-ruled Goa and raised in Bombay, she became active in the Goan nationalist
movement during college.
- In 1954, after Portuguese forces attacked and arrested satyagrahis demanding an end to colonial rule, India
closed its borders to Goa and imposed an economic blockade, cutting off sea, road, and rail links.
- In August 1955, thousands of satyagrahis attempted to enter Goa but were shot at by the Portuguese,
causing several deaths, while total censorship was in place.
- The nationalists had to find a way to counter these issues and to tell the people about the state of the
liberation movement and maintain morale among the nationalists.
- From 1955 to 1961, Libia and her colleague and later husband Vaman Sardesai ran an underground radio
station from the jungles of the Western Ghats.
- On November 25, 1955 the anniversary of Goa’s reconquest by the Portuguese in 1510 — the station, now
called ‘GoencheSodvonecho Awaz’ (Voice of Freedom of Goa) for Konkani broadcasts and ‘Voz de Liberdade’ for the Portuguese ones, began broadcating.
- Initially, the radio was operated from Maharashtra’s Amboli and later from Castle Rock in Karnataka.
- It was Libia who announced the news of Goa’s liberation from four-and-a-half centuries of Portuguese rule
on December 19, 1961.
