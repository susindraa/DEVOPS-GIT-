PwDs and Digital Personal Data Protection Rules

General Information:

- The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) is finalizing consultations on the Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act, 2023 and its draft rules.
    
- Concerns have been raised about Section 9(1) of the Act regarding guardianship consent for Persons with Disabilities (PwDs).
    

Key Concern:

- Section 9(1) clubs adult PwDs with children and mandates that their legal guardians provide consent for any digital personal data processing.
    
- Activists argue this undermines the autonomy of PwDs and reflects a flawed understanding of guardianship laws.
    

Understanding Section 9(1) Provision:

- The DPDP Act requires verifiable consent from a parent/legal guardian before processing the personal data of a child or PwD.
    
- The definition of PwDs lumps all individuals with disabilities together, assuming those with guardians are incapable of making legal decisions.
    
- Draft rules under Rule 10(2) require that the guardian be appointed by a court or designated authority.
    
- There is a lack of clarity on how guardian-based consent applies to PwDs.
    

Risk to Digital Rights of PwDs:

- Making guardian consent mandatory could lead to:
    
    - Exclusion from digital platforms like banking, government schemes, e-commerce, and education portals.
        
    - Increased control of guardians over PwDs‚Äô choices, restricting their ability to make decisions.
        
    - Legal ambiguity for guardians if consent leads to data misuse.
        
- A survey by PACTA and Saksham Disability found that 27.4% of PwDs had legal guardians, but many still managed their affairs independently.
    

Issues Highlighted:

- Undermining autonomy by ignoring the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (RPWD) Act, 2016.
    
- Legal confusion because the DPDP Act does not differentiate between limited and full guardianship.
    
- Practical challenges in implementation because there are no clear guidelines for guardian consent.
    
- Risk of gender-based discrimination, especially for women with disabilities.
    

Recommendations by Disability Rights Groups:

- Amend Section 9(1) to align with the RPWD Act, 2016, ensuring PwDs have decision-making autonomy.
    
- Provide clear guidelines on how guardian consent should be handled.
    
- Ensure digital accessibility barriers are addressed so platforms are more user-friendly for PwDs.

Budget Allocation for Urban Development

In 2015, the then government prioritized urban development, recognizing cities' 67% contribution to GDP. However, in its "Viksit Bharat" vision, urban development appears to be overlooked.

Budget Allocation for Urban India

- Total Outlay - ‚Çπ96,777 crore, up from last year's ‚Çπ82,576.57 crore. However, adjusting for inflation, the real allocation has declined.
- Underutilisation of Funds - Revised Estimates indicate only ‚Çπ63,669.93 crore will be spent by March, reflecting a 22.9% shortfall.
- Cuts in Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana Urban)- Allocation for FY 2024-25 was ‚Çπ30,170.61 crore, but Revised Estimates slashed it to ‚Çπ13,670 crore.
- Policy vs. Implementation Gap - Despite increased outlay, funds are misaligned with urban infrastructure needs, prioritizing capital-intensive projects over employment and sustainable development.

Way Forward for Urban Development

- Introduction of the Urban Challenge Fund
    - A new ‚Çπ10,000 crore fund announced for urban redevelopment.
    - Target set at ‚Çπ1 lakh crore, with 50% expected from private investments.
    - Reliance on private funding seems unrealistic, given past low participation
- Shift Towards Capital-Intensive Projects that generates employment and sustainability
    - Focus on green jobs and inclusive economic growth.

Declining Urban Transfers: Analysing Budget Cuts and Their Impact

- Transfers to urban India primarily occur through three channels ‚Äî direct transfers to Urban Local Bodies (ULBs); Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS); and Central Sector Schemes.
- Centrally Sponsored Schemes are funded jointly by centre and state and implemented through the State in sectors falling in the State and Concurrent Lists of the Constitution.
- Central Sector Schemes are implemented and financed by central govt directly
- Key Factors behind Reduction in Urban Transfers
    
    > Decline in Direct Transfers to ULBs ‚ñ† ULBs' share reduced from ‚Çπ26,653 crore to ‚Çπ26,158 crore. ‚ñ† Revenue loss due to GST (21% decline) not compensated adequately. ‚ñ† Cities may need to impose additional taxes on citizens. Cuts in Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) ‚ñ† PMAY(U) (CSS component): 30% budget cut compared to last year. ‚ñ† AMRUT & Smart Cities Mission: Decreased allocations, with nearly no funds left for Smart Cities. ‚ñ† SWATCH BHARAT MISSION (Urban): Retains ‚Çπ5,000 crore allocation, but only ‚Çπ2,159 crore (56% less) is expected to be spent. Shift in Focus to Capital-Intensive Metro Projects ‚ñ† Metro and Mass Rapid Transit Systems see increased funding. ‚ñ† FY 2024-25 Budget: ‚Çπ21,335.98 crore ‚Äî RE: ‚Çπ24,691.47 crore. ‚ñ† FY 2025-26 Proposal: ‚Çπ31,239.28 crore (46% rise). ‚ñ† Prioritizing metro projects over broader urban mobility raises concerns about inclusivity.
    

Need for a Law on Domestic Workers

The Supreme Court's recent directive to the Union government to explore the feasibility of a separate law for domestic workers is a significant step toward recognizing their rights.

‚Ä¢ The Court has ordered the Centre to form an inter-ministerial committee to examine the necessity of a legal framework for domestic workers' protection, regulation, and welfare.

Key Considerations for a New Law ‚Ä¢ Clear definition and employment proof: o An inclusive definition of domestic work is necessary for effective regulation. o Proof of employment is a critical prerequisite for enforcing labour laws. o Workers' unions have demanded mandatory employer registration to address this issue. ‚Ä¢ Employer resistance and workplace recognition: o Resistance by employers needs to be taken into account. Many employers do not consider themselves as such, nor do they view their homes as workplaces.

 

# Need for a Law on Domestic Workers

## Current Status
- Supreme Court has directed the Union government to explore feasibility of a separate law for domestic workers
- Court ordered formation of an inter-ministerial committee to examine necessity of legal framework
- Many domestic workers remain outside purview of key labor laws (Minimum Wages Act, Equal Remuneration Act)
- While some states have regulations, a uniform national law is missing

## Key Considerations for New Law
- **Clear definition and employment proof:**
  - Inclusive definition of domestic work necessary for effective regulation
  - Proof of employment critical for enforcing labour laws
  - Workers' unions demand mandatory employer registration

- **Employer resistance and workplace recognition:**
  - Many employers don't consider themselves as such or their homes as workplaces
  - New legislation should ensure minimum entitlements and grievance redressal mechanisms
  - Recognize regional & local aspirations while formulating laws

## Vulnerability Factors
- Workforce primarily composed of marginalized communities and migrant workers
- Labor protections often don't extend to domestic work
- Gendered perceptions lead to undervaluation of domestic work

## Challenges Faced
- **Low wages and exploitative conditions:**
  - Widely varying wages even within same locality
  - Forced additional tasks without extra compensation
  - Lack of job security and social security benefits

- **Social invisibility and discrimination:**
  - Undervalued work due to gendered perceptions
  - Harassment and humiliation from employers
  - Abuse cases rarely receiving media attention

- **Legal framework gaps:**
  - India has yet to ratify ILO Convention 189 on domestic workers
  - Previous judicial directives on registration of placement agencies had little impact
  - 2019 Code on Wages includes domestic workers but employment structure variations create complexities

## Way Forward
- **Regional models:** Examine Kerala's approach through "Kerala Domestic Workers (Regulation and Welfare) Act, 2021" which provides:
  - Rights to minimum wages
  - Dignified working conditions and written contracts
  - Protection against exploitation
  - Regulations for employment agencies
  - Stipulations on working hours, rest days, and mandatory social security

- Consider domestic workers' unions concerns when framing legislation
- While immediate transformation may be challenging, such a law would serve as foundation for long-term improvements

# POLITY AND GOVERNANCE

## Bhopal Criminalizes Begging

Bhopal has banned begging in all public places, including giving alms. The Bhopal District Collector recently issued orders enforcing strict measures, including FIRs for both beggars and donors. The move revives debates on anti-begging laws, often criticized as 'anti-poor' over rehabilitation-focused approaches.

- In December 2024, Indore's collector also banned almsgiving under **Section 163 of Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Samhita (BNSS)** as part of the Union government's Support for Marginalized Individuals for Livelihood and Enterprise (SMILE) scheme, 2022 which aims to rehabilitate beggars through medical care, education, and skill training to make cities "beggar-free" by 2026.

## Legal Status of Begging Across Other States

### Bombay Prevention of Beggary Act, 1959
- Begging is criminalized in several states under this Act
- Allows authorities to detain beggars and place them in institutions
- Has roots in colonial-era vagrancy laws
- Serves as the definitional basis of the SMILE scheme
- Identifies "begging" broadly to include:
 - Soliciting alms
 - Performing on streets
 - Selling items to earn livelihood
 - Merely appearing destitute with no visible means of subsistence

### Key Judicial Developments
- In 2018, the Delhi High Court decriminalized begging and struck down parts of the Bombay Act as "manifestly arbitrary"
 - Ruled it violated Article 21 (right to live with dignity)
 - Questioned how the state could criminalize begging while failing to provide basic necessities
- In 2021, the Supreme Court rejected a PIL to remove beggars, refusing an "elitist view" on a socio-economic issue

### Legislative Attempts
- **The Persons in Destitution (Protection, Care and Rehabilitation) Model Bill, 2016**:
 - Proposed repealing the Beggary Act
 - Suggested replacement with rehabilitation centers in every district
 - Some provisions still allowed police involvement and detention
 - Discussions stalled after 2016 with no further progress

### State Policies and Programs
- **'Beggar-Free City' Policies**: Despite the 2018 Delhi HC ruling, many states continue to criminalize begging
 - Maharashtra and others maintain similar laws
 - Several states announced plans to make cities "begging-free"
 - In 2020, Union Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment proposed rehabilitation-focused campaign in ten cities, including Mumbai
 - Beggary Act remains in force

- **Mental Healthcare Act, 2017**:
 - Includes provisions for caring for detainees with mental illness who are homeless or wandering
 - Aims to provide medical care rather than criminal punishment for mentally ill individuals found begging

## Historical Context
- The "beggar-free" city idea recalls Delhi's 2010 Commonwealth Games preparations
- Officials sought to remove beggars as a "nuisance" to create a "world-class city"
- Delhi government enforced zero-tolerance zones, using mobile courts and enforcement vans
- Used to detain beggars, slum dwellers, and street vendors

## Legal Framework
- **Legality of Orders Prohibiting Begging**:
 - Section 163 of BNSS, 2023: Allows magistrates to impose restrictions in cases of nuisance or apprehended danger
 - Consequences of Violation: Action under Section 223 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS)
   - Penalties: Six months to one year imprisonment and fine up to ‚Çπ5,000
   - Orders are temporary: Lasting up to two months, extendable to six months by state government

- **Constitutional Position**:
 - Constitution allows both Union and state governments to legislate on "vagrancy, nomadic and migratory tribes" under Concurrent List (Entry 15, List III)
 - During Constituent Assembly debates, proposal to add "control and eradication of beggary" to Union List was rejected
 - Dr. B.R. Ambedkar clarified beggary was already covered under "vagrancy"
 - This enables both central and state authorities to regulate it




# Arguments on Anti-Beggary Act

## Arguments in Favor of an Anti-Beggary Act

1. **Curbing Organized Begging Rackets**: Many beggars, especially children, are exploited by trafficking gangs (subjecting them to inhumane conditions). A law can help identify, rescue, and rehabilitate victims while punishing traffickers.

2. **Ensuring Public Safety and Order**: Unregulated begging at traffic signals, railway stations, and religious sites can lead to accidents and public inconvenience. Restricting begging can improve public hygiene and urban management.

3. **Encouraging Rehabilitation Over Dependence**: The law can mandate skill training, employment, and shelter homes instead of allowing people to rely on alms. A structured welfare system can help break the cycle of poverty.
   - The Bombay Prevention of Begging Act aimed to provide vocational training to beggars in 'beggar homes' to facilitate their reintegration into society.

4. **Legal Clarity and Uniformity**: A national law can standardize legal provisions while ensuring protection of rights.

5. **Preventing Nuisance and Exploitation of Public Sentiment**: Some individuals pretend to be disabled or destitute to gain sympathy and exploit public generosity. A law can help distinguish between genuine cases needing assistance and fraudsters.

## Arguments Against an Anti-Beggary Act

1. **Criminalizing Poverty Instead of Addressing Its Root Causes**: Many people beg out of extreme necessity, not choice. Instead of punishment, the state should focus on providing jobs, housing, and healthcare.

2. **Violation of Fundamental Rights**: The 2018 Delhi HC ruling held that criminalizing begging violates Article 21. It also infringes on personal liberty, forcing the homeless into detention.

3. **Failure of Past Laws**: Laws like the Bombay Prevention of Beggary Act, 1959 led to mass arrests but failed to reduce begging. Detention centers became overcrowded and poorly managed, worsening conditions for beggars.

4. **Discrimination Against the Poor**: Anti-begging laws often target the homeless, slum dwellers, and street vendors, pushing them further into poverty. Instead of eradicating begging, such laws hide poverty rather than solving it.

5. **Ignoring the Role of Social Welfare**: Begging is a symptom of unemployment, lack of education, and social exclusion. The government should expand social security schemes rather than penalizing the underprivileged.

**State Emblem of India**

The Union Home Ministry has urged State governments to prevent the misuse of the State Emblem of India, stressing that the Lion Capital must include the motto "Satyamev Jayate" in Devanagari script.

The abacus features sculptures of an elephant, a galloping horse, a bull, and a lion, separated by Dharma Chakras. ‚óã **Adoption as the State Emblem (on January 26, 1950)**: The official emblem depicts three visible lions (the fourth is hidden from view). A Dharma Chakra is in the center of the abacus, with: A bull on the right A galloping horse on the left Dharma Chakras on both sides ‚óã **Modifications from the Original**: The bell-shaped lotus was omitted. ‚óã **Motto**: The inscription "Satyameva Jayate" (Truth Alone Triumphs) in Devanagari script is placed below the emblem.

## About the Chief Election Commissioner and Other Election Commissioners Act, 2023

- Introduced significant changes to the selection process, salary structure, and eligibility criteria for appointing Election Commissioners in India.

---

## New Selection Process for CEC and ECs

- The **CEC and Election Commissioners (ECs)** are now appointed by the **President** based on the recommendation of a **selection committee** comprising:
  1. **Prime Minister** (Chairperson)
  2. **A Union Cabinet Minister** (nominated by the PM)
  3. **Leader of Opposition (LoP)** or leader of the largest opposition party in Lok Sabha

- The selection is made from a list of five persons prepared by a **Search Committee** headed by the **Minister of Law and Justice** and comprising two other members not below the rank of Secretary to the Government of India.

- The **Selection Committee** may go beyond the names suggested by the Search Committee and choose any other candidate.

- The appointment of the CEC and ECs remains valid despite any vacancy or defect in the Selection Committee's constitution.

---

## Previous Appointment Process

- Earlier, the **Election Commission (Conditions of Service of Election Commissioners and Transaction of Business) Act, 1991** governed the service conditions of Election Commissioners but did not define a selection process.

- The **President** appointed the CEC and ECs based on the advice of the PM and his Council of Ministers (CoM).

- Traditionally, the senior-most Election Commissioner was appointed as the CEC.

---

## Key Changes Under the New Act

- **Salary**: Aligned with **Supreme Court (SC) judges**.  
  - The bill initially proposed to be equivalent to a Cabinet Secretary, but after protest by opposition, it was decided to **retain** the status on par with Judges of SC.

- **Eligibility Criteria** (Newly introduced):
  - Candidates must be of **high integrity**.
  - Must have **experience in managing elections**.
  - Must be **serving or retired Secretaries (or equivalent)** to the Government of India.

---

## What Remains Unchanged?

- **Tenure & Reappointment**:  
  - Unchanged at six years or until 65 years of age, whichever is earlier, with no reappointment.

- **Removal**:  
  - The CEC can be removed from office in like manner and on like grounds as a SC judge (Article 324(5) of Indian Constitution), while ECs can only be removed on the CEC‚Äôs recommendation.

---

## Why Was the Process Changed?

- In the **Anoop Baranwal vs. Union of India** case, the Supreme Court ruled that the Election Commission of India (ECI) must be independent and recommended a collegium-style selection process, including PM, LoP, and the Chief Justice of India (CJI).

- However, Parliament passed the 2023 Act, **replacing the CJI with a Union Minister**, giving the Executive greater control over appointments.

---

## Controversy and Legal Challenge

- Several petitions, including one by **Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR)**, challenged the law in the SC, arguing that it weakens the ECI's independence.  
- The SC refused to stay the law but agreed to hear the case. A verdict is pending.

- The current appointment came hours after LoP Rahul Gandhi, while submitting a dissent note, urged a delay in the appointment until the SC‚Äôs ruling in the case.

---



## Concerns Raised Regarding the CEC and Other ECs Act, 2023

- **Government Dominance in Selection Committee**:  
  - The 2023 Act removed CJI‚Äôs presence, increasing executive control.  
  - The Selection Committee gives the ruling government a majority, reducing the Election Commission‚Äôs independence.  
  - In tribunals, from past cases, removing judicial members from selection panels has led to legal challenges regarding fairness.

- **Power to Ignore Search Committee‚Äôs Recommendations**:  
  - The Selection Committee can pick candidates outside the suggested panel, weakening the Search Committee‚Äôs role in ensuring qualified and impartial appointments.  
  - Example: In the CBI selection, ignoring the empaneled list led to allegations of favoritism.

- **Risk of Government Influence Over Salary**:  
  - Earlier, the CEC & ECs‚Äô salary was equal to that of SC judges, fixed by Parliament.  
  - The bill linked their salary to a Cabinet Secretary, controlled by the government, increasing potential Executive influence.  
  - This provision was later removed from the Act.

- **Narrow Eligibility Criteria**:  
  - Only those who have served as government secretaries (or equivalent) can be appointed.  
  - Excludes legal experts, election specialists, and other qualified individuals who could strengthen electoral oversight.  
  - Bureaucrats may be influenced by past government affiliations.

- **Lack of Parity in Removal Process among CEC & EC**:  
  - The CEC can be removed like a SC judge, whereas ECs can only be removed on the CEC‚Äôs recommendation.  
  - Creates an imbalance despite both having equal decision-making powers.  
  - A pro-government CEC could recommend removing ECs who oppose government actions.

- **Functioning of Selection Committee with Vacancies**:  
  - If the LoP position is vacant (e.g., before elections), the committee will consist only of government members, affecting neutrality in decision making.

- **Administrative Independence Not Addressed**:  
  - Recommendations for an independent ECI secretariat (like Parliament or the SC) were ignored, keeping the ECI dependent on the government for resources.

---

## Way Forward

- Enhancing Selection Committee Balance by including neutral members like the CJI.
- Expanding Eligibility Criteria to include legal experts, election specialists, and retired judges.
- Restoring Salary Parity with SC judges to ensure financial independence.
- Reviewing Removal Process to ensure
