### How to install Ansible
?
- Ansible can be installed using Python's pip, using the package manager ensures it's added to the system's path automatically.
- _"the easiest way is uh to use your package manager because all your package managers have ansible as your packages..."_
- **Verification:** After installation, Ansible can be verified using the command: ansible --version. This command will display the installed Ansible version.
- _"verify it using this command ansible hyphen hyphen version so as I do ansible hyphen iPhone version you can clearly see that it mentions that ansible is properly installed."_

### 2. Setting Up Passwordless SSH Authentication
?
- **Prerequisite:** Passwordless SSH authentication between the Ansible control node and the target managed nodes is essential for Ansible to function without manual password input.
- _"all that ansible requires is a passwordless authentication so if ansible can authenticate without any password to these machines so ansible can do anything..."_
- **Generating SSH Key Pair:** On the Ansible control node (Ubuntu in the example), an SSH key pair is generated using the command: ssh-keygen. The public key (id_rsa.pub) and private key (id_rsa) are created in the ~/.ssh directory.
- _"on the Ubuntu user what you will do is simply type SSH hyphen Keygen okay what SSS SSH hyphen Keygen will do for you is it will generate a key for you right that's why it's called SSH hyphen keychain what is the key it will generate a public private IP okay..."_
- **Copying Public Key to Target Node:** The public key from the Ansible control node needs to be copied to the authorized_keys file on each target managed node.
- The transcript demonstrates manually copying the content of the public key file (cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub) and pasting it into the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file on the target Ubuntu machine.
- The success of the passwordless authentication is verified by using ssh <target_ip_address> from the Ansible control node without being prompted for a password.
- _"in simple terms like if I have to explain it in one single line what I did is I just copied the public IP address of the ansible server to the authorized case of the target servers..."_

### 3. Ansible Ad-hoc Commands
?
- **Purpose:** Ansible ad-hoc commands allow for quick execution of single tasks on managed nodes without the need to write a full Playbook.
- _"you don't have to write playbooks all the times okay you can also run ansible commands from the CLI... in ansible terminology it is called as ansible ad hoc commands."_
- **Syntax:** The basic structure of an ad-hoc command is: ansible -i <inventory_file> <target(s)> -m <module_name> -a "<arguments>"</>-i: Specifies the inventory file containing the list of target hosts.
- <target(s)>:</> Can be a specific IP address, a hostname, or the keyword all to target all hosts in the inventory. You can also target groups defined in the inventory file (e.g., web_servers).
- -m: Specifies the Ansible module to be used (e.g., shell, copy, apt).
- -a: Specifies the arguments to be passed to the module.
- **Examples:**Creating a file on the target server using the shell module: ansible -i inventory all -m shell -a "touch devops_class"
- Executing a shell command to check the number of processors: ansible -i inventory all -m shell -a "nproc"
- Executing a shell command to check disk space: ansible -i inventory all -m shell -a "df"
- **Modules:** Ansible has a vast library of modules for various tasks. The documentation for these modules can be found by searching for "ansible modules" in a web browser.
- _"nobody knows everything because there are thousands of models in ansible so you can simply open your browser and search for ansible modules..."_
- **Inventory Grouping:** The inventory file allows for grouping servers under logical names (e.g., db_servers, web_servers) enclosed in square brackets. This enables targeting specific groups of servers with ad-hoc commands or Playbooks.
- _"in the inventory file you can do grouping of your servers okay so here you can simply mention as DB servers... and here you can mention as web server..."_

### 4. Writing a Basic Ansible Playbook
?
- **Purpose:** Playbooks are written in YAML format and are used to define a set of tasks to be executed on managed nodes. They are suitable for orchestrating multiple steps or more complex configurations.
- _"whenever somebody is asking you have you written any ansible playbooks that means have you written any ansible files... Playbook only when you want to execute set of these commands..."_
- **YAML Structure:** Ansible Playbooks start with --- to indicate the beginning of a YAML document. Each playbook is defined as a list of dictionaries.
- **Key Components of a Basic Playbook:**name: A human-readable name for the Playbook.
- hosts: Specifies the target hosts (from the inventory file) where the Playbook will run (e.g., all, a specific host, or a group).
- become: When set to true, it enables privilege escalation (like sudo) to execute tasks as the root user. become_user can be used to specify a different user for privilege escalation.
- tasks: A list of tasks to be executed on the target hosts. Each task has:
- name: A descriptive name for the task.
- Module invocation: Specifies the Ansible module to use and its arguments (e.g., apt: name=nginx state=present or service: name=nginx state=started).
- **Example Playbook (install_nginx.yaml):**---
- - name: Install and start Nginx
- hosts: all
- become: true
- tasks:
- - name: Install Nginx
- apt:
- name: nginx
- state: present
- - name: Start Nginx
- service:
- name: nginx
- state: started
- **Execution:** Ansible Playbooks are executed using the ansible-playbook command, followed by the inventory file (if not in the default location) and the name of the Playbook file. ansible-playbook -i inventory firstplaybook.yaml
- **Verbosity:** The -v, -vv, or -vvv options can be added to the ansible-playbook command to increase the verbosity of the output, providing more detailed information about the tasks being executed, including SSH connections and module actions.

### 5. Introduction to Ansible Roles
?
- **Purpose:** Ansible Roles provide a structured way to organize and reuse Ansible content (tasks, handlers, variables, templates, etc.). They are particularly useful for managing more complex configurations.
- _"whenever you want to write some complicated playbooks... what ansible has done is it has come up with a concept called ansible roles."_
- **Structure:** A role has a predefined directory structure (e.g., tasks/, handlers/, vars/, templates/, files/, meta/, defaults/, tests/).
- **Creating Roles:** Roles can be created using the ansible-galaxy role init <role_name> command. This command generates the basic directory structure for the role.
- ansible-galaxy role init kubernetes (example from the transcript)
- **Using Roles in Playbooks:** In a Playbook, roles are included using the roles keyword, specifying a list of roles to be applied to the target hosts.
- ---
- - name: Configure servers with roles
- hosts: all
- roles:
- - common
- - webserver
- - database
- **GitHub Repository for Examples:** Abhishek refers to his GitHub repository (github.com/techbeatly/ansible-examples) for more advanced examples of Ansible Playbooks and roles, including a JBoss Standalone configuration. He encourages viewers to explore this repository for further learning.
- **Role Directory Structure Details:**meta/: Contains metadata about the role, such as author, license, and dependencies.
- defaults/: Contains default variables for the role.
- vars/ and group_vars/: Used for defining variables (the transcript mentions the difference will be explained in interview questions).
- tests/: Contains test cases for the role.
- handlers/: Contains handlers, which are special tasks that are triggered by other tasks using the notify directive.
- tasks/: Contains the main list of tasks to be executed by the role.
- templates/: Contains Jinja2 template files that can be rendered and deployed to managed nodes.
- files/: Contains static files that can be copied to managed nodes.
- readme.md: Provides documentation about the role.
