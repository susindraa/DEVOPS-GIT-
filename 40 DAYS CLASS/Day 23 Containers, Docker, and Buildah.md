# Briefing Document: Introduction to Containers

**Source:** Excerpts from a YouTube video transcript titled "Pasted Text" (Day 23 of a Complete DevOps Course by Abhishek).

**Date:** Likely recorded around the time of the "Day 23" marker in the mentioned DevOps course.

**Author/Speaker:** Abhishek (host of the YouTube channel).

**Overview:**

This briefing document summarizes the key themes and important ideas presented in Abhishek's introduction to containers, part of his complete DevOps course. The video aims to lay the foundational understanding of containers, explain the concept of Docker, and briefly introduce Buildah as an alternative containerization tool. Abhishek emphasizes the importance of understanding virtual machines (covered in a previous session, Day 3) as a precursor to grasping container technology.

**Main Themes and Important Ideas:**

1. **Announcement of Telegram Group:**

- Abhishek announces the creation of a Telegram group for his channel to share important resources, such as content he encounters on blogs and other platforms.
- The Telegram group is intended to be a more effective way to share and access resources compared to YouTube community posts, where information can get lost over time.
- **Quote:** "I created a telegram group for our Channel and I will use this telegram group to share some important resources the resources that I'm that I come across while reading some content or you know while I surf through the medium blocks or any other resources so it will be very handy for me to share the resources on the telegram group instead on the YouTube Community post where the information gets ignored or you know after some time it is very difficult to scroll back and look into the resources that I share."
- Viewers are encouraged to join the group via a link in the video description.

1. **Introduction to Containers - The Basics:**
?
- The session focuses on understanding the fundamental concepts of containers as a crucial step before delving into more complex topics like creating projects and container interactions.
- **Quote:** "So what we'll do today is we will try to understand the basics or introduction of containers this is very important because before you jump onto the uh Concepts like creating projects with containers or you know how one container interacts with the other container all of these things it is very important for you to understand the basics of container of containers."

1. **Relationship Between Physical Servers, Virtual Machines, and Containers:**
?
- Containers are presented as an advancement over virtual machines, which themselves were an advancement over physical servers in terms of resource utilization.
- Understanding virtual machines (VMs) is deemed essential before learning about containers.
- VMs address the problem of underutilized resources on physical servers by using a hypervisor to create logical isolations with their own operating systems.
- **Quote:** "Before understanding the world of containers it is very important to understand the world of virtual machines because if you consider virtual machines as advancement to physical servers then containers is an advancement to Virtual machines."
<!--SR:!2025-05-10,5,190-->

1. **Limitations of Virtual Machines and the Need for Containers:**
?
- Despite improving resource utilization, VMs can still lead to wasted resources. Even when an application on a VM is at peak load, it might not be using the full allocated resources (CPU, RAM).
- This inefficiency becomes significant in large-scale deployments, leading to unnecessary costs.
- **Example:** A VM allocated 25GB RAM might only use 10GB even at full application capacity.
- **Quote:** "Even after moving to Virtual machines you have realized that one of your virtual machine or all of your virtual machines are not using the resources to their fullest capacity that means virtual machine one has application one and this application one on its best day let's say that uh this virtual machine this application one receives the maximum threshold load and even after that it was only using 10 GB Ram and some 6 CPU that means it is using only less than half or it is using like you know it is wasting 15 GB RAM and some you know 19 CPUs even when this application is running on the full capacity."
<!--SR:!2025-05-08,3,210-->

1. **Advantages of Containers:**
?
- Containers aim to solve the resource wastage problem associated with VMs by being more lightweight.
- **Reason for Lightweight Nature:** Containers do not have a complete operating system. Instead, they share resources from the host operating system (either the underlying physical server's OS or the VM's OS).
- **Quote:** "Docker containers basically as I told you they do not have okay they do not have a complete operating system...whereas containers what they do is they use the resources from the base operating system or they use the resources from the virtual machine or physical server that they are running on."
- A container is described as a package or bundle containing the application, its libraries (dependencies), and system dependencies.
- This results in significantly smaller image sizes compared to VM snapshots (MBs vs. GBs), making them easier to ship and transfer.
<!--SR:!2025-05-07,2,150-->

1. **Security Considerations (Briefly Mentioned):**
?
- While containers offer benefits, VMs are currently considered more secure due to their complete operating system providing better isolation.
- Containers have a logical isolation that isn't as complete as the isolation provided by separate OS kernels in VMs.
<!--SR:!2025-05-07,2,150-->

1. **Container Deployment Models:**
?
- Containers can be created directly on top of a physical server's operating system or on top of virtual machines.
- The trend is shifting towards the latter (model 2 - containers on VMs, especially in cloud environments) due to reduced maintenance overhead associated with managing physical servers.
- Cloud providers like AWS abstract away the underlying physical infrastructure, allowing users to focus on creating VMs and then containers.
<!--SR:!2025-05-06,1,130-->

1. **Introduction to Docker:**
?
- Docker is introduced as a very popular containerization platform that has simplified the process of working with containers.
- Docker made containerization more accessible through its user interface, command-line tools, and the concept of Dockerfiles.
- **Docker Lifecycle (Simplified):Docker File:** A script containing instructions to build a Docker image.
- **Docker Image:** A read-only template that packages the application and its dependencies.
- **Docker Container:** A running instance of a Docker image.
- **Docker Commands (Introduced):**docker build: Used to convert a Dockerfile into a Docker image.
- docker run: Used to create and run a container from an image.
- Docker Engine is mentioned as the core component that manages the building, running, and managing of Docker containers.
<!--SR:!2025-05-07,2,150-->

1. **Introduction to Buildah (Alternative to Docker):**
?
- Buildah is presented as another tool for building container images.
- **Reasons for Buildah's Emergence:**To address the "single point of failure" concern with the Docker Engine. If the Docker Engine goes down, all Docker containers stop.
- To potentially solve the issue of Docker images creating many layers, which can consume significant storage.
- To offer a simpler approach, potentially working more closely with tools like Skopeo and Podman.
- Buildah allows users to create images using shell scripts with Buildah commands instead of relying solely on Dockerfiles.
- Buildah can create Docker-compatible (OCI compliant) images.
<!--SR:!2025-05-07,2,150-->

**Key Takeaways:**
 
- Containers are a form of OS-level virtualization that offers more efficient resource utilization compared to virtual machines.
- Understanding virtual machines is a prerequisite to understanding containers.
- Containers achieve lightweightness by sharing the host operating system's kernel and resources.
- Docker is a widely adopted containerization platform that simplifies container management through Dockerfiles and command-line tools.
- Buildah is an alternative tool emerging to address some limitations and concerns associated with Docker.
- The core lifecycle of Docker involves creating a Dockerfile, building it into an image, and running the image as a container.
<!--SR:!2025-04-19,1,230-->

**Next Steps (Implied):**
?
- The course will likely delve deeper into Docker commands, Dockerfile syntax, and container management in subsequent sessions.
- Buildah will also be explored as an alternative image building tool.
- Practical projects using containers are expected later in the course.
