### **1. Understanding Operating Systems**
?
- **Definition of an Operating System (OS):**
  - An operating system is a software layer that manages hardware resources and provides an interface for users and applications to interact with the system.
  - Examples include Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Key Components of a Server:**
  - CPU, RAM, Input/Output (I/O) devices, and storage are the fundamental components of any server or computing device.
  - The OS acts as the bridge between the hardware and the user/software.
<!--SR:!2025-05-05,12,270-->

---



### **2. Basics of Linux Operating System**
?
- **Linux Overview:**
  - Linux is a widely used open-source operating system, especially in DevOps environments.
  - It is lightweight, flexible, and supports various distributions like Ubuntu, CentOS, Fedora, and Debian.
- **Linux Architecture:**
  - The architecture includes:
    - **Kernel:** The core component managing hardware resources.
    - **System Libraries:** Provide APIs for applications to interact with the kernel.
    - **Shell:** A command-line interface for interacting with the OS.
    - **User Applications:** Programs running on top of the OS.
- **Practical Example:**
  - When you purchase a laptop (e.g., Dell), it comes with hardware and an installed OS (e.g., Windows). Similarly, servers can have Linux installed as the OS.
<!--SR:!2025-05-04,1,150-->

 

### **3. Shell Scripting Basics**
?
- **What is Shell?**
  - Shell is a command-line interpreter that allows users to interact with the OS by executing commands.
  - Common shells include Bash, Zsh, and Fish.
- **Basic Commands:**
  - `pwd`: Prints the present working directory.
  - `ls`: Lists files and directories in the current location.
  - `cd`: Changes the directory (e.g., `cd /home/ubuntu`).
  - These commands help navigate and manage the file system.
- **File System Navigation:**
  - Understanding the current directory (`pwd`) and moving between directories (`cd`) is essential for managing servers.
  - Example: Moving from `/home/ubuntu` to `/home/ubuntu/bundle` using `cd bundle`.
<!--SR:!2025-05-04,11,270-->






### **4. Memory Management**
?
- **Checking RAM Usage:**
  - On Windows, you can check RAM size via System Properties and Task Manager.
  - On Linux, similar checks can be done using commands like `free -m` or `top`
- **Example Scenario:**
  - If your laptop has 8GB of RAM and 7GB is already in use, you can assess resource utilization to ensure optimal performance.
<!--SR:!2025-05-04,1,150-->






### **5. DevOps Tools and Concepts**
?
- **Configuration Management:**
  - Tools like Ansible, Puppet, and Chef are used for automating configuration management.
  - Focus on understanding the concept rather than mastering all tools at once.
- **Automation in DevOps:**
  - Automation is central to DevOps practices, improving efficiency in building, testing, and deploying software.
  - Tools like Terraform and CloudFormation templates fall under Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
- **Learning Strategy:**
  - Start with one tool (e.g., Ansible) and gradually explore others.
  - Focus on practical application rather than theoretical depth during initial learning.
<!--SR:!2025-05-05,3,230-->






### **6. Real-Time Shell Scripting Project**

### **2. Basics of Shell Scripting**
?
#### **a. What is Shell Scripting?**
- A **shell script** is a file containing a series of commands written in a scripting language that can be executed by the shell (e.g., Bash).
- Used to automate tasks like file management, system monitoring, and application deployment.
#### **b. Components of a Shell Script**
1. **Shebang (`#!`)**:

   - Common examples:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
```
or
```bash
#!/bin/sh
```
1. **Commands**:
   - Shell scripts are composed of Linux commands.
   - Example:
```bash
echo "Hello, World!"
```
1. **Execution**:
   - Save the script with a `.sh` extension (e.g., `script.sh`).
   - Make it executable using `chmod`:
```bash
chmod +x script.sh
```
   - Run the script:
```bash
./script.sh
```
