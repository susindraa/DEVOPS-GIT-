#### **1. Agile Methodology**
?
- **What is Agile?**
  - A project management methodology focusing on iterative development (breaking work into small, manageable chunks called **sprints**).
  - **Sprints** are short cycles (2-4 weeks) where teams deliver incremental improvements.
  - Advantages: Faster feedback, adaptability, continuous delivery.
  - Key terms: Sprint Planning, Backlog Grooming, Retrospectives, Daily Standups.

- **What is Jira?**
  - A project management tool by Atlassian to implement Agile workflows.
  - Tracks tasks (stories, bugs, epics), team velocity, and project progress.
  - Used for sprint planning, assigning tasks, and visualizing workflows (Kanban/Scrum boards).
- **Key Features**
  - Create tickets (tasks), assign priorities, and track progress.
  - Generate reports (e.g., burndown charts) for team performance.

#### **3. Confluence & SharePoint**
?
- **What are they?**
  - **Confluence** (Atlassian) and **SharePoint** (Microsoft) are knowledge-sharing platforms.
  - Centralize documentation (e.g., CI/CD setup guides, troubleshooting steps).
  - Collaborate on internal wikis, project specs, and team documentation.
- **Why Learn Them?**
  - Critical for onboarding and knowledge transfer in teams.
  - Example: Documenting infrastructure setup for future DevOps engineers.
- **Practice Tip**: Use the same Atlassian account for Confluence trials.

#### **4. ServiceNow**
?
- **What is ServiceNow?**
  - A platform for **IT Service Management (ITSM)**.
  - Key use cases:
    - **Incident Management**: Track production issues (e.g., alerts from monitoring tools).
    - **Change Management**: Plan and approve infrastructure/application changes (e.g., deploying patches).
- **Why Learn ServiceNow?**
  - Used in enterprises for compliance and tracking critical changes.
  - Integrates with monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Datadog) to auto-create incidents.

#### **5. Read the Docs**
?
- **What is it?**
  - Open-source platform for hosting technical documentation.
  - Integrates with GitHub to auto-deploy docs from Markdown files.
  - Example: Kubernetes documentation is hosted on Read the Docs.
- **Why Learn It?**
  - Essential for open-source projects to maintain transparent, versioned docs.
  - DevOps engineers often set up CI/CD pipelines to automate doc updates.

#### **6. Git & GitHub**
?
- **Beyond Code Management**
  - **GitHub Projects**: Track tasks, issues, and sprints (similar to Jira).
  - **Azure Boards**: Microsoftâ€™s alternative for Agile project tracking.
  - Open-source projects (e.g., Kubernetes) use GitHub Issues/Projects for roadmap planning.
