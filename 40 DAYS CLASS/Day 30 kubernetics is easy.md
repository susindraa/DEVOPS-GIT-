hello everyone my name is Abhishek and welcome back to my channel so today we are at day 30 of our complete devops

course and in this class we will start our journey with kubernetes so firstly kubernetes is easy Yes you

heard it right so many people worry about kubernetes and whenever we talk about devops you know people focus most

of their time on cicd Solutions so I've seen many people focusing a lot on

building pipelines you know talking about live CI CD project and even if you

search on YouTube you'll find bunch of cicd related stuff on YouTube and everybody is focused on it but the key

player in the market is kubernetes take 20 resumes search for devops related

jobs if you don't find kubernetes you can definitely come back and in the comment section ask me okay I did not

see kubernetes in one of the videos but you are saying kubernetes is important trust me that will never happen because

in all of the job descriptions you will see kubernetes because kubernetes is the future

kubernetes is a future of devops so if you want to do a marathon journey in

devops right if you want to do a short Sprint or if you just want to get into

devops and you know you just want to be around in devops then yeah you can survive yourself by just learning about

simple devops topics you can do projects on CI CD and you can you might also find

some uh simple uh devops job roles which offers you some positions but it's not

devops it is basically build and release engineering or it is basically some release engineer roles which offers you

jobs on just CI CD and other devops stuffs but if you want to like I told you do a marathon in devops or if you

want to do a long run in devops Journey kubernetes is the future now why I am

saying this because everybody knows that these days people have started moving

towards microservices now not these days people have started moving towards micro services from last six to seven years

very actively and you all know from last six classes we have been talking about Docker and containers right so I have

explained enough why containers are very important if you haven't watched our previous videos from day 24 to date 30

uh day 29 if I am not wrong we just talked about containers evolution of containers introduction to Containers

importance of containers and we also did some live projects on containers that is using Docker so if you haven't watched

that videos I highly recommend you to watch those videos before you jump on to kubernetes because the only prerequisite

for learning kubernetes is docker now why do I say Docker not containers

because most of the people are very acquainted to the term called Docker they relate themselves more when we say

a Docker but in general I am talking about containers so if you want to be a

key player in this space you need to understand the concept of containers very well it's not like when I say

understand containers don't talk about simple Docker commands Okay I'm not talking about the docker commands at all

whenever I speak to you in my videos what I always tell you is get strong

with your Basics so I am only talking about the basics of the containers that means you need to understand what

container is bringing into the picture how is it different from a virtual machine what is your networking isolation what is your namespace

isolation right and why containers are very lightweight in nature you all know

that containers are lightweight but why are they lightweight how do you secure your containers we talked about destroys

we talked about multi-stage Docker builds so learn about all of these things before you start your journey with kubernetes now I am assuming all of

you have watched my previous videos from day 24 to day 29 or you already know the

concept of containers and Dockers very well okay so this is the assumption that I'm making and I'm going forward with

today's video so I'm again saying you if you haven't watched the previous videos or if you do not have the concept or the

understanding of containers then don't go forward but instead go back and watch the previous videos okay now

the first question that you should get before learning kubernetes is what is the difference between Docker and

kubernetes okay because from day 24 to day 29 I explained you

how to build projects on Docker we deployed some real-time applications we

you know secured the containers using displayless images multi-stage builds and we saw about the life cycle of

talker and containers and how talker which is a container platform what was

Docker I also explained in the previous class Docker is a container platform that means Docker is making you the

interaction with the containers or you know Docker is making your container Journey very easy because it provides a

complete container life cycle whether it is using the docker engine or using the docker CLI it makes you the I mean it

makes your container Journey very easy but now what is kubernetes then so if you already have a container platform

and if the container platform is offering you a lot of things what is kubernetes so for the textbook

definition kubernetes is nothing but a container orchestration platform

okay so what is kubernetes kubernetes is a container orchestration platform so this is for just a test book definition

of understanding that means just for your one word answer you can say that Docker is a container platform whereas

kubernetes is a container orchestration platform that does not make you understand anything right if I just tell

you here that okay learn about kubernetes kubernetes is just a container orchestration platform and if

I close this topic here you will not understand anything if you are just a beginner with kubernetes so

let's try to understand the Practical implication or what I am like you know buy container orchestration platform how

is it different from Docker platform or a container platform let's try to see now if you have worked with containers

before one thing that you will notice is containers are ephemeral in nature

I use this term previously also if you haven't I mean if this term

hasn't got registered with you ephemeral is nothing but something that is short

life or you know short living in nature that means containers can die and you

know

revive anytime so what do I mean by this basically if you have a host let's

assume that this is your host on top of which you have installed Docker on top of which you created let's say some 100

containers okay now one of these containers is taking a lot of memory

okay all of a sudden we started taking a lot of memory so this one impacts your 99th or you know it impacts your 50th

container why it impacts because this container is not getting enough resources so it will die or if it is

already not scheduled what happens is this container will not get started

right so basically the life of containers is very short if there is a

lack of memory resources or you know if there is some issue with the container like the image is not getting pulled in

any of the cases the container will immediately die because there is only one host here and on top of that I

installed a 100 containers one of the container there is no relation between container number one and there is no

relation between container number 100 but still what is happening here is the container one which is consuming a lot

of memory is killing the container 100 it is not directly killing but because of the

linear how Linux works okay so if you want to understand this thing in deep what happens is there is priority uh

that is allocated for each process in Linux so now what happens is that when one of the

uh you know process is taking a lot of memory depending upon your Linux and kernel rules the process like Linux have

to Define right or kernel has to decide which process to kill let's say there

are 100 process it cannot randomly kill process number 50 right so there is a particular algorithm in kernel using

which it deletes one of the processes so here in this case what I am telling you is container one was taking a lot of

resources because of which container 100 is not at all getting created or it is directly dying okay so this is one use

case what is the problem here because you have only one host and on top of on top of it you have installed docker

and you have created 100 containers one of the container is dying because of the other thing so what is one problem that

we have learned here single host okay so this is problem number one

now let's move to problem number two what is problem number one the nature of Docker or the nature of this container

platform is scope to one single host so because it is only one single host the

containers which are there it is impacting each another and if one of the container is impacting the other

container there is no way that this container can come up okay so this is problem number one now the problem

number two let's say somebody has killed one of your container

killed container now what will happen if somebody kills the container immediately the

application that is running inside the container will be not

accessible right why is what is the reason for it being not accessible because the

container got killed and unless there is a user or a devops engineer who starts

this container somebody has to act upon the container that got killed okay so this behavior is called as Auto healing

okay so what is auto healing Auto healing is a behavior where without users manual intervention okay so

without the user's manual intervention your container should start by itself

but does it happen in the docker let's say you are playing around with your Docker containers on your personal laptop does the container come up

automatically no it does not come up now there are hundreds of reasons why your

container can go down okay so there are hundreds of reasons

why your container can go down now the problem is that a devops engineer cannot

continuously monitor some 10 thousands of containers okay so in your personal

laptop you might have just one single container but when you are working in production or when you are working with

your organization you will see some 10 thousands of containers now you can always not do Docker PS right always a

devops engineer cannot perform the docker PS command and see which containers are in running state

so there has to be a mechanism that is called as Auto healing so Auto healing

is a very important feature that Docker or any container platform by itself is missing so what is problem number two

Auto healing what was problem number one single host nature of your Docker

container now let's move and see what is problem number three so this problem number three is called as

Auto scaling now let us try to understand what is this problem number three

so again let's take the same example you have a easy to instance or a physical host on

top of which you install docker okay on top of which you have let's assume you just created one container

okay just for easy understanding in usual terms you will not just create one container but let's say that you just

created one container and this container you know it has some resources called as

okay this host let's say it is a 4GB RAM and 4 CPU now this container can maximum

consume up to 4G 4 CPU and 4 GB Ram because it is the maximum capacity of

your host in general your container will not get all the required resources from your host because the host itself has a

lot of processes that is running right but for easy understanding let's say maximum this container can go up to 4

CPU and 4GB okay or you know for some reason what has happened is your user

whoever is the user okay so you have some 10 000 users your

application has some 10 000 users but what happened is during a festival season let's say some Christmas or

dasara or any Festival season your users all of a sudden went from 10 000 to 1

lakh so this happens all the times right so let's say a movie is released on Netflix

and this is a very uh popular movie something like Marvel or Avengers or any popular actors movie so usually Netflix

might receive load from 10 000 users but on this particular occasion Netflix will receive some 10 000. sorry

some 1 million or one lakh or whatever the load gets increased so to satisfy

this increasing load or to you know uh for the container of the application to

act upon the increasing load you need to have a specific feature which is called as Auto scaling now what is auto scaling

as soon as the load gets increased okay there are two ways one is manually

you increase the application there is only one container right so manually you increase the container count from one to

let's say 10 okay because the load is increased by 10 times I am just giving an example so manually you increase the

load from one to ten or the containers similar containers like similar to C1 C1 what you will do is you will create 10

different C1 containers or it has to happen automatically

okay as soon as this sees the load uh the docker container it has to immediately understand that oh okay so

the load is getting increased so I have to scale up myself but Docker does not support both of the things right so

let's say you have one container called C1 okay so manually what you will do is

let's say you want to increase from 10 000 to 20 000 user request what you have to do you have to create another

container called C1 and apart from this you have to configure load balancing okay if there is no load balancing you

know you cannot tell user that okay for first 10 000 users access my application URL as

172.16.3.4 and for next 10 000 your users access my application on 170.16.3.5 that is not possible Netflix

will never tell you this right all that you do as an end user is just access netflix.com

okay so you just access netflix.com and your favorite movie so now what is

happening behind the hood is there is a load balancer which is actually sending you the load whether you are doing it

manually or automatically whether you increase these containers count uh manually from one to ten or

automatically if your platform is increasing from 1 to 10 behind the hood there is a load balancer okay so this

load balancer basically says that oh okay now I understood that instead of one container there are two or instead

of two there are three or there are ten so let me equally split the load okay so there has to be this mechanism of load

balancer which supports your auto scaling so this is feature number three which is missing in your docker okay so

what are the three different things that I told you the first one that I told you is the problem that we had with the

containers is it is a single host one that is the docker platform basically

relies on one single host whether you install it on your laptop or ec2 instance what you are doing is on one

specific ec2 instance you are installing Docker and top of which you are installing containers whether the containers are like you know if you have

10 containers 100 containers you are just simply installing on that specific host and you are serving the traffic

okay now the problem number two that we have is auto healing what is happening with auto healing is that your

containers are not able to heal automatically if the container is dying then devops engineer should keep track

of this 10 000 or 1 lakh or 1 million containers and he has to start by himself or when customers report that

your application has gone down you have to start which is a very bad user experience now the problem number three I just explained is about Auto scaling

and the problem number four or the final problem that I that I want to bring here

is talker is a very minimalistic or very simple platform

okay what is simple platform by default Docker does not support any of your

Enterprise level

application support okay Docker does not provide any Enterprise level support now

what do I mean by that let's say you don't know Docker at all what are the minimal things that you require for

running your application even on a virtual machine okay so it's not like running your college project if you want

to run your college project you can just run it on your laptop but when we deal with Enterprise applications or when we

deal with Enterprise Solutions you have a lot of things to deal with so one of the example is your application should

have a load balancer let's keep writing firewall okay without

load balancer your application is not Enterprise ready without firewall your application is not Enterprise ready or

you know there are some such parameters let's keep uh writing them okay and what

is the other thing your application has to Auto scale or at least it has to support scaling

your application has to Auto heal or at least it has to support healing okay and

then you know your application has to support some API gateways

if you keep writing this number will go it will keep increasing okay so what are

these things called some Enterprise level standards but Docker does not

support this Enterprise level standards by default okay or you know instead of

you going to Docker spam or any other high-level Docker concepts by default if you're just using Docker these all

things are not supported so it's a very simple or minimalistic platform so who is solving all of these problems let's

write all the four problems here and let us see how kubernetes is solving each of this problem the first problem is a

single host second problem is Auto scaling

third problem is Auto healing

fourth problem is Enterprise level support

I'm sorry if there are any typos so these are the four problems that we discussed there are hundreds of problems

but these are the four problems that are very important now I cannot tell you all of the problems because we are just starting our journey with kubernetes now

who is solving these problems as I told you the one simple answer is

kubernetes so now you can answer this question right if somebody is asking you in the

interviews who is solving you the problem of Docker or what is the difference between docker

and kubernetes okay so if somebody asks you this question you have the answer

now okay so all these five slides or all these 15 minutes I just talked about this one simple question the problem

with Docker or the difference between Docker and kubernetes so now you should be able to explain these problems let me

tell you the solutions immediately okay so till now I just explained you the problems with Docker and I just told you

that kubernetes will solve the problem but I know that you people will not trust me you will say that oh okay explain me how it will solve because if

anybody says you that oh okay kubernetes solves the problem you should not trust you should ask the question okay explain

how kubernetes solves this problem so let's try to understand by default kubernetes is a cluster

what is a cluster cluster is basically group of nodes

okay so previously when we installed Docker we just installed on one personal laptop or you know we just installed on

one simple ec2 instance so kubernetes in general in a production use case it is

installed in a master node architecture okay so what is masternode architecture

just like Jenkins we create clusters so that means to say whenever we install kubernetes we just create one master

node and we create multiple nodes okay so somebody will directly ask me oh does

that mean kubernetes cannot be installed on one single node you can definitely do it but that is only your developer

environment okay so to just practice kubernetes or you know to just start working around with kubernetes you can

also install kubernetes on one single node but in general in production kubernetes is installed in whether it is

high availability or a standalone mode kubernetes is generally installed as a cluster so now what happens okay I might be

installing it as a cluster but your question will be what what is the Advent is that I get if I install as a cluster the advantage would be in the previous

slide I told you if you go back to this problem here I told you that this container is actually getting affected

by this one container that is taking a lot of memory right now what will happen is if you install kubernetes in

kubernetes there are two nodes let's assume so if this node okay so let's assume this is the specific node and

this is container one and container 99 okay so if container one is impacting this container 99 immediately kubernetes

will put this container 99 in a different node okay so that what happened this container 99 is not

affected by this one or the meaning is that a faulty node okay so there is a

faulty node for example or there is one faulty application in the node which is impacting the other applications so

kubernetes because it has multiple node architecture immediately it can put nodes in a different uh sorry pods in a

different node or applications in a different node okay so because of which you have a cluster-like architecture

okay so this is one problem that is already solved by using the cluster behavior of kubernetes so kubernetes is

by default cluster in nature now the second problem what is that auto healing

so kubernetes basically has something called as uh okay I don't want to go

into the details but kubernetes has something called as replication controller or replica sets so replica

set is a new name replication controller is old name okay just like you can consider version one and version two so

kubernetes has something called as replica set so all that you need to do is you don't even have to deploy a new

container okay let's say you have C1 okay and your C1 or your application is

receiving load increase load previously it was receiving 10 000 on one Festival it is receiving one lakh for example

okay or one tenth of a million so what we can simply do is kubernetes is

basically dependent on yaml files so everything in kubernetes is all about yaml files so in replication

controller.aml file replica set controller.yaml file or even in the deployment ml file now if you don't know

what these terms are don't worry all that you need to understand is as a devops engineer you can go to one

specific yaml file yaml is basically a indentation format file just like Json files okay so you can simply go to this

yaml template file and say that include increase my replicas from

1 to 10 because my traffic is increasing I know that tomorrow is Festival so I

want to increase traffic from 1 to 10 this is manual way and kubernetes also supports something called as HPA which

is horizontal pod Auto scalar okay so using which you can directly say that okay whenever there is a load just keep

increase okay if one of my container is receiving a threshold of 80 percentage so whenever you see that the load is

reaching threshold of 80 percent just spin up one more container okay so in such cases it will keep up spinning

containers if the load is even going from 1 million to 10 Millions even your horizontal pod scalar feature of your

kubernetes can handle so this is how you are achieving Auto scaling two problems solved now let's go with

the problem number three what is the problem number three that I told you Auto healing so what is auto healing

basically the word heal itself means that whenever there is a damage kubernetes has to control the damage

Okay so kubernetes controls and

fix the damage so it will either control or it will fix

so most of the time it will control the damage now what is the meaning of controlling the damage or what is the

meaning of Auto healing so let's say for some reason one of your container is going down

there are hundreds of reasons why your container can go down I'll explain you what are the classic problems of why a

pod can go down or why a container can't go down there are multiple things and there are some standard things that you

can remember uh or you know standard debugging steps for a container when container goes down but for now let's

assume that your container is going down so in case of Docker like I told you you have to look into the docker PS commands

look into all the list of containers and understand okay one of my container went on so let me restart or let me recreate

this container whereas kubernetes has a feature called Auto healing

using this Auto healing feature whenever the container is going down even before the container goes down

kubernetes will start a new container okay

so even before this container goes down how kubernetes will basically work is as soon as kubernetes receives uh in in

kubernetes there is something called as API server okay so tomorrow I'll explain you the kubernetes architecture during

that time I'll explain you what is API server what are the different components or how kubernetes architecture is

present but for now there is something called as API server whenever the API server understands that one of the

container is going down or whenever it receives a signal coin container is going down immediately what kubernetes

does is even before this container goes down it will roll out a new container

okay so whenever it will roll out a new container the end user will not even understand that the container has gone

down and a new container has come up unless your application like let's say your us is a very heavy application or

you know in some cases that might happen but I am only talking about the generic terminology or general uh usage purposes

so even before your container goes down a new rollout or a new container is created or a new pod is created in

kubernetes we usually deal in terms of PODS not in containers but for now let's

understand that uh even if your container is going down before that kubernetes starts a new container so

using which we have achieved a feature called Auto healing so three problem

solved I explained you three problems Auto healing Auto scaling single host nature of Docker because kubernetes is a

cluster it has scope from for putting one container from one specific node to another specific node

what is the fourth problem the fourth problem is the Enterprise uh nature like

Docker I told you it does not has entered uh sorry uh Enterprise nature okay so it does not have many Enterprise

support capabilities like it does not support firewalls it does not support load balancers or by default okay so it

does not support a lot of things unless you go to Docker spam so what

people have done is the people at kubernetes so kubernetes is basically

a tool that was originated from Google okay so people at Google were using a

specific tool called Borg where they say that kubernetes is one of the parts of work so they say that Borg

is uh like you know um a even a better solution and kubernetes is one of the like you can

consider as one of the parts of blocks or one of Borg or you can consider kubernetes as initial solution for Borg

so we don't have much details here but the people at Google what so Borg is not an open source store so the people at

Google what they have done is they have built a Enterprise foreign

container orchestration platform okay so why they have built a container

orchestration platform that supports Enterprise level is because the docker platform which is just a container

platform right Docker was just a container platform so it does not have all of these capabilities but to run

your application on a pad on a platform which is not Enterprise ready it is not suggestible

right so that's why nobody use Docker in production okay so dogger is never used in

production so you might use Docker spam in production but Docker independently is

never used in production because it's not a Enterprise level solution so Docker is basically a container platform

which will allow you to play with containers on your personal laptop or on your ec2 instances but in general you

can consider that Docker has some container runtime which will allow you to run containers or which will allow

you to manage the life cycle of containers but it's not an Enterprise solution because it does not have all

the list of capabilities like Auto healing water scaling load balancer support firewall support support for API

gateways okay so all of white listing blacklisting so these are all features that you require to run your application

in production now Flipkart or Amazon cannot just say that Docker platform is a platform that is running container so

let me move to Docker so the first question the organizations mncs or your corporates will have is okay

I appreciate a solution like Docker platform but is it suitable for our

organization does it support all of these capabilities because I want to Blacklist few clients or I want to

whitelist a few particular IPS I want to Blacklist uh somebody who is uh trying

to perform uh you know DDOS attack or denial of service attack so all of these

capabilities are required which Docker does not have and kubernetes is the one that is aiming to solve this problem now

does kubernetes solve this problem 100 percent so to answer this question in a nutshell

the answer is definitely no so you might talk to experts in kubernetes you can

talk to anyone like who have been in the world of kubernetes so it is not as simple as we do it in the world of

virtual machines okay so when we were do dealing with virtual machines like 10 years back or you know uh seven to eight

years back everybody was on Virtual machines and the way you can integrate this external tools to Virtual machines

was Far easy and virtual missions offer you far more security when you compare

with uh containers so kubernetes is evolving and it is backed up by very wonderful people at cncf okay so there

are many contributors to cncf even I am one of the contributors to cmcf cncf where the goal of this community is to

make kubernetes a better place okay so you are basically I mean

kubernetes basically has a very good backup and every day there are lots of

enhancements that are done to kubernetes so you will see that there are many projects in the cncf like you have

podman you have build packs you have uh you know uh Prometheus all of these are

cncf incubated or you know cncf adopted projects so they might be created by someone else but cncf has adopted this

project so what is the meaning is that there is a community that is constantly focusing on developing the kubernetes

community not just the kubernetes application but the tools around kubernetes because kubernetes also by

default does not provide you a lot of capabilities but kubernetes provides a concept uh like you know Concepts like

custom resources custom resource definitions using which you can extend kubernetes to any level

okay so let's say by default kubernetes uh for example by default kubernetes does not support Advanced load balancing

capabilities okay so everybody's knows this and this is a practical truth so by default kubernetes has services and Q

proxy which will just give you some basic load balancing like right round robin but this is one of the major

problems and how kubernetes solves this problem because kubernetes introduced custom resources and custom resource

definitions and they told applications like fi nginx that okay you create a kubernetes controller using which people

can use your load balancer even in kubernetes okay and this concept was called as Ingress controllers so

similarly kubernetes is advancing every day and kubernetes is improving and it

is reaching this near 100 percent okay so we will reach that near 100 so that is one of the reasons why even you know

some of the companies hesitate to implement kubernetes and production people are migrating slowly to kubernetes in production because of all

this support and all of these things so kubernetes is one such tool that you have to definitely watch out for and

like I told you in the very first slide kubernetes is easy

don't worry about kubernetes if you understood these four topics that I told you so today your part is done like

let's assume that you have learned already five percent of kubernetes okay now what we will focus is learning the

next 95 percent and this next 95 percent will completely depend on your foundations that is your first five

percent that is to understand why you need to learn kubernetes if you understand the why statement why you

need to learn kubernetes then you will understand with your effort not directly with your effort in learning kubernetes

you will understand the risk 95 percent okay so we will slow by slow I mean in

our next classes step by step we'll learn about the concepts like pods we'll learn about the concepts like deployments Services even before all of

these things I'll explain you the architecture of kubernetes okay because that is very important and on the very first day like tomorrow

when I explained to the architecture of kubernetes might be some people might not understand the complete architecture and

you might feel that oh there are so many components in kubernetes now I have to learn about all of these components but

on the very first day you will not understand all the components I'm very sure about it you might understand the

definitions you might feel like you understood it but practically to gain understanding of all the kubernetes

components it will take some time so don't lose hope in our next videos we'll start learning with pods we'll start learning with deployment Services

Ingress controllers we'll start talking about admission controllers so it is a long journey and stay with me you will

learn kubernetes definitely because kubernetes is very easy I hope you like this video if you like

the video click on the like button if you have any feedback for me definitely post that in the comment section and don't forget to share it with your

friends and your colleagues thank you so much for watching the video take care everyone bye see you in the next video

# **Notes: Introduction to Kubernetes - Day 30 of Complete DevOps Course**

#### **Presenter: Abhishek**

---



### **1. Introduction to Kubernetes**
?
- **Kubernetes is Easy**: Despite its reputation, Kubernetes is straightforward if you understand its core concepts.
- **Why Kubernetes?**
  - Kubernetes is a key player in the DevOps space.
  - While CI/CD pipelines dominate discussions, Kubernetes is critical for modern DevOps roles.
  - Almost all DevOps job descriptions mention Kubernetes, making it essential for long-term career growth.
<!--SR:!2025-05-12,7,270-->

---

### **2. The Importance of Containers**
?
- **Containers as a Foundation**:
  - Containers are lightweight and enable microservices architecture.
  - Understanding containers (not just Docker commands) is crucial for Kubernetes.
  - Key container concepts:
    - Difference between containers and virtual machines.
    - Networking and namespace isolation.
    - Lightweight nature of containers.
    - Securing containers using tools like multi-stage builds and distroless images.
- **Prerequisite for Kubernetes**:
  - Strong understanding of Docker and containers.
  - Watch previous videos (Day 24–29) for foundational knowledge.
<!--SR:!2025-05-06,1,190-->

---

### **3. Docker vs. Kubernetes**
?
- **Docker**:
  - A container platform that simplifies interaction with containers.
  - Provides lifecycle management for containers.
  - Limitations:
    - Single-host nature.
    - Lacks auto-healing and auto-scaling capabilities.
    - Minimal Enterprise-level support (e.g., load balancers, firewalls).
- **Kubernetes**:
  - A container orchestration platform.
  - Solves the limitations of Docker by providing advanced features.
<!--SR:!2025-05-06,1,190-->

---

### **4. Problems with Docker**
?
1. **Single-Host Nature**:
   - Docker operates on a single host, leading to resource contention.
   - Example: One faulty container can impact others due to shared resources.
2. **No Auto-Healing**:
   - If a container dies, it requires manual intervention to restart.
   - In production environments with thousands of containers, this is impractical.
3. **No Auto-Scaling**:
   - Docker does not automatically scale containers based on traffic.
   - Manual scaling requires creating new containers and configuring load balancers.
4. **Lack of Enterprise Features**:
   - Missing features like load balancing, firewalls, API gateways, etc.
   - Not suitable for large-scale, production-grade applications.
<!--SR:!2025-05-06,1,190-->

---

### **5. How Kubernetes Solves These Problems**
?
1. **Cluster Architecture**:
   - Kubernetes operates as a cluster with multiple nodes (master and worker nodes).
   - Faulty containers or nodes are isolated and moved to healthy nodes.
2. **Auto-Healing**:
   - Kubernetes monitors containers using the API server.
   - If a container fails, Kubernetes automatically starts a new one before the user notices downtime.
3. **Auto-Scaling**:
   - Kubernetes supports scaling via YAML files or Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA).
   - HPA spins up new containers when traffic exceeds a threshold (e.g., 80% CPU usage).
4. **Enterprise-Grade Features**:
   - Kubernetes provides advanced capabilities through custom resources and integrations.
   - Examples:
     - Ingress controllers for advanced load balancing.
     - Extensions for firewalls, API gateways, and more.
