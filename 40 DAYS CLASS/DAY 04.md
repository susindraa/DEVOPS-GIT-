[[DAY 03 Virtual Machines]]
### Introduction to Cloud Providers and VM Creation
?
1. **Overview of Cloud Providers**:
   - The instructor mentions that the session will cover creating virtual machines on AWS, Azure, and on-premise environments.
   - Emphasizes the importance of understanding how to create and manage VMs efficiently.
1. **Creating Virtual Machines**:
   - **AWS Console**:
     - Users can log into the AWS console from their personal laptops to request a virtual machine.
     - AWS provides APIs for different services, such as EC2 for compute instances, S3 for storage, and EBS for volumes.
   - **Azure Portal**:
     - Similar to AWS, users can log into the Azure portal to create and manage VMs.

### Automating VM Creation
?
1. **Efficiency through Automation**:
   - Manually creating VMs through the AWS or Azure portal is inefficient, especially when handling numerous requests.
   - Automation is crucial for improving efficiency.
1. **Using APIs for Automation**:
   - AWS EC2 API allows users to programmatically create and manage EC2 instances.
   - Scripts can be written to make API calls to AWS, ensuring requests are valid, authenticated, and authorized.
   - Example: A script can automate the creation of 100 VMs instead of manually creating each one.
1. **Authentication and Authorization**:
   - Requests to create VMs must be valid, authenticated, and authorized.
   - AWS uses IAM (Identity and Access Management) roles and policies to manage permissions.

### Tools and Templates for VM Management
?
1. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**:
   - **AWS CloudFormation**:
     - Allows users to define infrastructure using templates.
     - AWS processes the template and creates the requested number of VMs.
   - **Terraform**:
     - Mentioned as a popular tool for managing infrastructure across multiple cloud providers.
     - Will be covered in detail in a separate class.
1. **AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit)**:
   - AWS-specific tool that provides initial support for new AWS services.
   - Preferred over Terraform for AWS-specific tasks due to its proprietary nature.

### Practical Steps for VM Creation
?
1. **Creating an AWS Account**:
   - Step-by-step guide on creating an AWS account and setting up a free tier.
   - Importance of selecting the correct region to avoid unnecessary charges.
1. **Creating Key Value Pairs**:
   - Necessary for logging into EC2 instances.
   - Users need to create a key pair to securely access their VMs.
1. **Accessing VMs**:
    - Once the VM is created, users receive an IP address.
    - Key value pairs act as passwords for logging into the VMs via terminals.

### Future Classes

1. **Automation and Login Processes**:
    - The next class will demonstrate how to automate VM creation and login processes.
    - Will cover scripting and automation tools to streamline these tasks.

### Additional Notes

- The instructor emphasizes the importance of efficiency and automation in DevOps practices.
- Encourages students to ask questions in the comment section or reach out via LinkedIn.
- Requests students to share the videos with others interested in learning DevOps.

This class aims to provide practical knowledge on creating and managing virtual machines in cloud environments, highlighting the importance of automation and efficiency in DevOps workflows.
