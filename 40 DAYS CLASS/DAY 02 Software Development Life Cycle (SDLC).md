6. **Overview of SDLC:**
?
   - SDLC stands for Software Development Life Cycle.
   - It is a process followed by the software industry to design, develop, and test high-quality software.
   - The end goal is to deliver a high-quality product.

2. **Phases of SDLC:**
?
   - **Planning:** Gathering requirements from customers and stakeholders.
   - **Defining Requirements:** Creating documents like the Software Requirement Specification (SRS).
   - **Designing:** Involves High-Level Design (HLD) and Low-Level Design (LLD). HLD includes scalability and availability considerations, while LLD includes specific functions and modules.
   - **Building:** Developers write code based on the designs.
   - **Testing:** Quality Assurance (QA) engineers test the software to ensure quality.
   - **Deployment:** The application is promoted to production for customers.

2. **DevOps Role in SDLC:**
?
   - DevOps engineers primarily focus on automating the building, testing, and deployment phases.
   - Automation leads to efficiency and faster delivery.
   - DevOps ensures that processes are followed without manual intervention.

2. **Importance of Understanding SDLC:**
?
   - Essential for everyone in an organization, whether a developer, tester, or DevOps engineer.
   - Helps in understanding the standards followed across organizations.

2. **Agile Methodology:**
?
   - Modern organizations use Agile methodology.
   - Agile involves short sprints, where small chunks of work are completed iteratively.

6. **DevOps Focus:**
   - As a DevOps engineer, the primary focus is on automating and improving the efficiency of the building, testing, and deployment phases.
   - Even though developers write code, QA tests it, and deployment happens, DevOps engineers automate these processes to remove manual intervention and speed up delivery.

### Recap and Additional Information:
- Recap of Day 1: Discussed what DevOps is, why it's needed, and how to introduce oneself in a DevOps interview.
- Importance of understanding SDLC for all roles within an IT organization.
- Encouragement to engage with the community through comments, sharing the channel with others interested in learning DevOps.

This class provides foundational knowledge about the SDLC and highlights where DevOps fits into this lifecycle, emphasizing automation and efficiency.
